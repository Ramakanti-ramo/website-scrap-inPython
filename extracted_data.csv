The bench presided over by Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud also asked the Chairman and Managing Director of SBI to file an affidavit on or before 5 pm on March 21 stating that the bank has disclosed all details of the bonds to the ECI.
The bench, also comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna, B R Gavai, J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, referred to its earlier orders on the matter and said the operative directions required the SBI to submit details of the electoral bonds purchased since the interim order dated April 12, 2019 till date to the ECI.
“Such details, the court has indicated ‘shall include the date of purchase of each electoral bond, the name of the purchaser of the bond and the denomination of the electoral bond purchased’,” the bench said, referring to a previous order.
“In the second part of the operative direction…SBI was required to submit ‘the details of political parties which have received contributions through electoral bonds’ since the interim order dated April 12, 2019, till date to the ECI,” it added.
“SBI was required to disclose details of each electrical bond encashed by political parties, inclusive of the date of encashment and the denomination of the electoral bond,” the court said, adding, “the above narration and a plain reading of paragraph 219 of the judgment of February 15, 2024 (striking down the electoral bonds scheme) indicates that SBI was required to submit all details both in terms of the purchase and in terms of receipt of contributions.”
The bench said “the expression ‘include’…clearly demonstrates that the inclusive part was treated as illustrative and not exhaustive of the nature of disclosure which was to be made by SBI.”
“In other words, there is no manner of doubt that SBI is required to make a complete disclosure of all details in its possession. This we clarify would comprehend the alphanumeric number and the serial number of any of the bonds which were purchased and redeemed,” the court ruled.
Appearing for the SBI, Senior Advocate Harish Salve said there is no reservation on the part of bank in disclosing all the details which are in its possession and custody.
Recording his statement, the court said, “In order to fully effectuate the order and to obviate any controversy in the future, we direct that the chairman and managing director of SBI shall file an affidavit on or before 5 pm on Thursday, indicating that SBI has disclosed all details of the electoral bonds which were in its possession and custody and that no details have been withheld from disclosure in terms of the directions contained in paragraph 221 of the judgment.”

"Electoral bonds data: Months before 2019 polls, BJP got over Rs 3,941 crore, 77% of its year’s count","The ruling BJP redeemed over Rs 3,941.57 crore between March 2018 to May 22, 2019, according to a fresh set of data released by the Election Commission today.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/modi-3.jpg?w=640,"In all, the BJP has redeemed at least Rs 8,451.41 crore since launch of the scheme.","That the BJP is the No. 1 recipient of poll bonds is a trend that was established since the inception of the scheme.
Indeed, the ruling BJP redeemed over Rs 3,941.57 crore between March 2018 to May 22, 2019, according to a fresh set of data released by the Election Commission today. And 77.4% of this (Rs 3,050.11 crore) flowed into the party’s coffers in March, April and May 2019, the three months in the run-up to Lok Sabha polls.
The Lok Sabha polls 2019 were announced on March 10 that year and counting of votes was done on May 23.
In all, the BJP has redeemed at least Rs 8,451.41 crore since launch of the scheme.
Along with Lok Sabha polls, there were Assembly polls for Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha as well.
The geography of the branches from where these bonds were issued, shows that BJP got money from across the country with major contributions from Mumbai (Rs 1,493.21 crore), Kolkata (Rs 1,068.91 crore) and New Delhi (666.08 crore).
In November-December 2018, there were Assembly polls in Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana, Mizoram. BJP had lost MP, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan and returned to the government in Bhopal after a defection in Congress.
Bonds redeemed during months of October and November 2018 showed that BJP received Rs 330.41 crore in total. The next tranche was opened in January 2019 and the party redeemed bonds worth Rs 173 crore.
It was the Lok Sabha polls that opened the tap.
The window opened in early March in 2019, just before Lok Sabha polls were announced and in March that year, BJP redeemed bonds valued at Rs 769.48 crore.
In April, when polling began, the BJP’s redemption surged to Rs 1572.93 crore and in May that year, the party redeemed bonds for Rs 707.70 crore.
Data also shows that Kolkata accounted for 27 per cent of the BJP’s total collections during the period March 2018 to May 2019, showing how this was emerging as its new battleground – it won an unprecedented 18 of the state’s 42 seats.
Over 38 percent of the BJP’s redemptions were of bonds from Mumbai and the party redeemed Rs 666.08 crore (17%) in New Delhi. From Hyderabad, where BJP has little presence, it redeemed Rs 106.26 crore."
"Spike in 2021 poll year: For DMK, Future Gaming, Mega Infra, India Cements big donors","According to the data, the party received a total of Rs 656.5 crore via poll bonds from April 19 2019 till November 14, 2023.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/dmk-electoral-bonds.jpg?w=640,"Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and DMK leader M K Stalin speaks during a rally at the conclusion of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, in Mumbai, Sunday, March 17, 2024. (PTI Photo)","The DMK, currently the ruling party in Tamil Nadu, was one of three parties which disclosed the names of its poll bond donors, according to the latest data put out by the Election Commission on Sunday.
According to the data, the party received a total of Rs 656.5 crore via poll bonds from April 19 2019 till November 14, 2023.
In 2019-2020, coinciding with the May 2019 general elections, the DMK received contributions totalling Rs 45.50 crore, even as the party was out of power in the state. The major donors included India Cements with Rs 10 crore, Lakshmi Machine Works (LMW) with Rs 1.50 crore, RAMCO Cements with Rs 5 crore, Mega Infrastructure with Rs 20 crore, Apollo with Rs 1 crore, Triveni with Rs 5 crore, Birla with Rs 1 crore, and IRB with Rs 2 crore.
It is not clear if Mega Infra listed by DMK is the same as Megha Engineering, which was incorporated in 2006, while RoC records show a company named Mega Infrastructure incorporated in 2014.
In 2020-2021, the DMK saw contributions totaling Rs 80 crore. Future Gaming and Hotel Services Pvt Ltd (FGH) donated Rs 60 crore, while Mega chipped in with Rs 20 crore.
While the State Assembly elections were held in early 2021, the 2021-2022 financial year saw a big jump in the poll bond contributions received by the DMK, adding up to Rs 302 crore. FGH alone contributed Rs 249 crore, with Mega giving Rs 40 crore, Sun TV Network Rs 10 crore, India Cements Rs 4 crore, and Triveni Rs 3 crore.
The local body polls held in February 2022 were no less significant. The flow of funds via poll bonds during this period, notably from entities like FGH, sustained the momentum.
Among the major donors, FGH has been closely associated with the DMK for many years. While Santiago Martin, the owner of FGH, is known for his close association with DMK; he was targeted by late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa in 2011 for his close ties with the DMK’s first family.
Martin’s son-in-law, Aadhav Arjuna, used to be a close aide of Chief Minister M K Stalin’s son-in-law, Sabareesan, and was seen as an “insider” of DMK’s political and strategic operations in the 2021 Assembly polls, a period when FGH contributed Rs 249 crore to the party.
Arjuna, a basketball player-cum-gym trainer, would also take part in the seat-sharing talks with the DMK’s smaller allies. However, he failed to get a DMK ticket in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, and joined the VCK, a DMK ally, last month.
Triveni, another DMK donor, is engaged in infrastructure and engineering projects, with origins in Salem, and also has stakes in mining operations in Odisha. LMW, also based in Tamil Nadu, is engaged in machine tools manufacturing.
In 2022-2023, the poll bond contributions to the DMK added up to Rs 185 crore, including Rs 160 crore from FGH, and Rs 25 crore from Mega. FGH contributed an additional Rs 40 crore in 2023."
Over half of JD(S)’s electoral bond donations came from Megha Engineering,"According to the details submitted to the Election Commission of India by H D Deve Gowda, national president of the JD(S), electoral bond donations from MEIL amounted to Rs 50 crore – nearly 56 per cent of total received by the party.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/hd-deve-gowda.jpg?w=640,JD(S) president and former PM H D Deve Gowda. (Photo: Janata Dal Secular/ X),"Janata Dal (Secular), which was among the parties to have disclosed the identity of their electoral bond donors, received more than half of its total Rs 89.75-crore donations from Hyderabad-based Megha Engineering and Infrastructures Ltd (MEIL).
According to the details submitted to the Election Commission of India by H D Deve Gowda, national president of the JD(S), electoral bond donations from MEIL amounted to Rs 50 crore – nearly 56 per cent of total received by the party.
Run by Krishna Reddy, MEIL is involved in marquee projects of the Telangana government such as the Kaleswaram Dam project. In total, the company and its subsidiaries have spent more than Rs 1,200 crore on electoral bonds between April 2019 and November 2023, as per data released by the Election Commission. This makes it the second-largest purchaser of electoral bonds.
In October 2019, the Income Tax department raided the offices of the company. Following this, a probe was also initiated by the Enforcement Directorate. On April 12 that year alone, MEIL had purchased bonds worth Rs 50 crore. In March 2019, it had donated bonds worth Rs 10 crore to JD(S); it also donated Rs 40 crore via poll bonds to the JD(S) in 2023.
While MEIL was the biggest donor to the JD(S), which has aligned with the BJP in Karnataka to fight the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, the second-largest donor to the party was the Embassy Group of Companies, which donated Rs 22 crore. All the bonds from the Embassy Group were received by the JD(S) in 2018 – Rs 3 crore in March, Rs 7 crore in April and Rs 10 crore in May, two days after the announcement of the 2018 election results that led to a hung Assembly.
The Embassy Group is headed by Jitendra Mohandas Virwani, a major builder and realtor in Bengaluru. He has developed several prominent properties in the city and partnered K J George, currently Karnataka’s Energy minister, in the development of the Embassy Golf Links – one of the most prominent tech parks in the city.
The group also faced raids by the Income Tax Department in June 2022.
JSW Steel was another major donor to the JD(S), donating electoral bonds worth Rs 5 crore in three payments in 2019, between April 6 and 11. JSW runs a steel unit at Ballari and was at the centre of a controversy over the state government’s plan to sell 3,667 acres of land to the firm. In 2019, when the JD(S)’s H D Kumaraswamy was Karnataka chief minister, the state government had agreed to sell the land, but the sale was put on hold amid legal and political opposition to the move. Two years later, the BJP government under B S Yediyurappa had also decided to sell the land to the firm, but that plan was also later shelved.
Other major electoral bond donors to the JD(S) include Shankaranarayana Constructions (P) Ltd (donated Rs 5 crore), Biocon (Rs 2.5 crore), Amar Raj Groups (Rs 2 crore), Shahi Exports (Rs 1.5 crore), and Infosys Technologies Ltd (Rs 1 crore)."

"INDIA shine at Mumbai rally sets the stage for showdown with NDA, but all eyes on what next","The Shivaji Park unity show, Rahul's symbolic memorial visits, good crowds put a spring in Congress step; BJP hits back",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/WhatsApp-Image-2024-03-17-at-20.40.41-1.jpeg?w=640,"In speech after speech, the INDIA partners resolved to evolve a common minimum programme to fight the Narendra Modi-led BJP, accusing it of “dictatorship”, “communalism” and “corruption”. (Express Photo by Amit Chakravarty)","Twenty-four hours after the Lok Sabha election schedule was announced, Mumbai became the site of the battleground between INDIA versus the NDA as Rahul Gandhi wrapped up his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra.
The Congress leader’s final day was dotted with symbolism, starting from Mani Bhavan, Mahatma Gandhi’s long-time headquarters in then Bombay, and ending at Chaitya Bhoomi, the cremation site of Dr B R Ambedkar. Rahul skipped the Vinayak Damodar Memorial opposite Chaitya Bhoomi, but visited the Bal Thackeray Memorial next door after the BJP tried to put Rahul ally Uddhav Thackeray in a spot over it.
While the BJP seized on Rahul’s decision to not visit the Savarkar memorial to attack Congress ally Shiv Sena (UBT), questioning his commitment to Hindutva, the day belonged to INDIA for once, with its partners rallying around the coalition that has been sputtering its way to takeoff. It will also go some distance towards countering the impression that the Congress kept INDIA allies out of Rahul’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra.
Sena (UBT) president Uddhav Thackeray was a prominent presence at the dais with Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, apart from other senior Congress leaders, at Sunday evening’s rally held at Shivaji Park – a ground that holds much significance for the Shiv Sena – to mark the formal conclusion of the Yatra.
Also present was the other main Congress ally in the state, NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar), as well as its INDIA partners DMK, National Conference, Aam Aadmi Party and RJD. Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav sent a letter expressing his support.
In speech after speech, the INDIA partners resolved to evolve a common minimum programme to fight the Narendra Modi-led BJP, accusing it of “dictatorship”, “communalism” and “corruption”.
That the BJP was paying attention was clear from the focus it devoted to the rally. Maharashtra BJP president Chandrashekhar Bawankule posted an old video clip of the late Bal Thackeray, in which he is heard saying, “If such a situation arises where the Shiv Sena has to go with the Congress, I would rather shut down my organisation.”
“We are not attributing anything to Uddhav Thackeray,” Bawankule added. “We are just reminding him what Bal Thackeray said about (his) unholy alliance with the Congress… The Sena (UBT) already compromised its Hindutva ideology in 2019 by joining hands with the Congress and NCP for power. Now, it is ready to compromise its stand on freedom fighter Veer Savarkar…”
However, this line of attack is unlikely to cut much ice, given that Uddhav’s alliance with the Congress-NCP now carries the patina of four years, and that many Sena loyalists still swear by him rather than the Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, seen as the BJP’s creation. Plus, old-timers still remember that Bal Thackeray himself had supported Congress PM Indira Gandhi’s Emergency move in 1975.
The hope in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) ranks now will be that the euphoria of Sunday’s rally will be the glue that will paper over the strains of seat-sharing. With Rahul drawing good crowds in Maharashtra, a state where the battle is still far from decided in the NDA’s favour, the Congress will bank on it for a better deal for the party – particularly when on the other side of the table are heavyweights such as Uddhav and Sharad Pawar. The Yatra is also seen to have generated a buzz for the Congress among its traditional Muslim and Dalit vote banks.
Noted Dalit writer Arjun Dangle is among those who believes this is the case. “There is a strong perception among Ambedkarites that the BJP will undermine the Constitution if it returns to power. This time it will be reflected in the voting, with a sizeable number of Dalits shifting away from the BJP,” he said.
A senior leader aligned with the BJP admitted that the party remains unsure of the Maharashtra scene: “Although we split the Shiv Sena and NCP, it is difficult to ascertain its benefits electorally.” Like Uddhav, Sharad Pawar can expect to get some sympathy vote for the BJP’s hand in breaking the NCP, a party that he nurtured through long, hard years, at a time when he is in his twilight.
Any Maharashtra predictions have also been rendered difficult due to the Maratha reservation move, with no one sure whether the OBCs have been suitably placated.
On Sunday, as INDIA prepared for its unity show, the BJP dispatched former CM and Congress-turned-BJP Maratha leader Ashok Chavan to meet Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange Patil, who keeps making threats of renewing his agitation.
Senior BJP leader and Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis told The Indian Express: “We are confident that the people’s mandate will be for PM Narendra Modi… Fissures within the INDIA bloc or the MVA are inevitable.”
But at least on Sunday evening, as dark descended on Shivaji Park, INDIA showed a spark – enough to cast a little shadow over the BJP’s target of 45-plus seats out of the total 48."

As rescuers reached out to them with water and oxygen, disaster management group personnel with gas cutters moved through the rubble to rescue those trapped inside. A huge contingent of police personnel have been deployed in the area, along with fire services personnel, disaster management groups, and ambulances.
Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who recently received a head injury, visited the spot and said the building was illegally constructed and has asked authorities to take action against those responsible.
“This is a congested area. Such areas have developed over the years. A section of promoters (builders), not all, should keep in mind that poor people live around their construction site. I have asked the mayor (Firhad Hakim), and he said the building had no legal permission. I have asked the authorities to take action against the builder,” said Banerjee.
“The administration stands by the families who have lost their near ones and those who are injured. I have asked the administration to see about the (reconstruction of) houses which were damaged. Those who are still (trapped) will be rescued soon,” she said.
Mayor Firhad Hakim, who along with Minister Sujit Bose oversaw rescue operations since Sunday night, said those trapped will be rescued soon. “More bodies may be inside. We will give Rs 5 lakh to the families of those dead and Rs 1 lakh to those who were injured. Thirteen people were rescued. Those injured have been admitted to a local hospital,” said Hakimt.
“It was an illegal building. I have asked the police to take action against the builders,” added Hakim.
According to residents, concrete chunks started falling off the under-construction building after midnight, and later the entire structure collapsed, with parts of it falling on neighbouring residences in the densely populated area. The building collapsed on at least seven houses around the site, where residents had been sleeping.
They said the building had been under construction for the last six months. They also alleged that the building lacked proper permission from Kolkata Municipal Corporation and the police.
In a post on X late Sunday, Suvendu Adhikari, BJP MLA and leader of the opposition in the state Assembly, wrote: “A 5 storey building (illegally constructed) has collapsed at Hazari Mollah Bagan; Garden Reach; Metiabruz, KMC Ward No. 134. This particular area falls under the so called ‘citadel’ of Hon’ble Mayor of Kolkata and Municipal Affairs Minister. I urge @chief_west, Secretary @HomeBengal, @CPKolkata to immediately involve the West Bengal State Disaster Management Team for immediate Rescue & Relief.”
Indranil Khan, the state BJP Yuva Morcha president, said on X, “The catastrophic collapse of an unauthorised illegal building at Azhar Molla Bagan in KMC Ward No 134, Garden Reach area, crushing and trapping several people including children underneath, is a fatal consequence of the corrupt civic system in Kolkata running in tandem with TMC-backed syndicate mafia. While we appeal for immediate and adequate measures from the state administration Police, Fire Brigade, Disaster Management teams for rescue of the trapped and optimum treatment of the injured.”"
LS poll dates in: Opposition sees Advantage BJP in Maharashtra’s first five-phase schedule,"In a state where BJP is facing tough challenge, Opposition leaders see a plan to ride on Modi everywhere. Regions where NDA talks toughest will vote last",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/cover_cb725b.jpg?w=640,"Rival parties point out that the BJP and its allies are caught in a bitter seat-sharing tussle here, and it gives them more time now to coordinate when it comes to critical constituencies as well as figure out the best utilisation of their star campaigners. (PTI) Photo)","FOR THE first time, the Lok Sabha elections for its 48 seats will be held across five phases in Maharashtra, spread out between April 19 and May 20. The Opposition believes this elongated schedule is only meant to give the BJP, with its better resources, organisational strength and unflagging election machinery, an advantage.
For example, the fact that Western Maharashtra and North Maharashtra are being kept for polling in the last two phases (May 13, 20). Rival parties point out that the BJP and its allies are caught in a bitter seat-sharing tussle here, and it gives them more time now to coordinate when it comes to critical constituencies as well as figure out the best utilisation of their star campaigners.
Marathwada is one of the regions which will see polls in the most phases – three, for 8 seats altogether. This is being seen as a precautionary step given that this is a battleground of the Shiv Sena and NCP, and may see its different factions collide. The Maratha reservation issue and the resultant OBC backlash have also made Marathwada a potentially volatile territory.
In Vidarbha’s 10 seats in contrast, polls are taking place in two phases, right at the start (April 19, 26).
At the same time, Mumbai voting in the last phase might harm the BJP’s prospects. Party leaders point out that its vote base in the region are North Indian immigrants, forming 20% of the voters, who often head to their native places for summer vacations.
The BJP is not shy of admitting that it wants to cash in on the Modi factor in the maximum seats. Given the gap between phases, his rallies can now be more easily planned across regions. Apart from Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will be holding mega rallies. As one of BJP star campaigners, Maharashtra Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis will cover all the 48 constituencies, plus hold joint rallies with CM Eknath Shinde (Shiv Sena) and Deputy CM Ajit Pawar (NCP).
“The 2024 Lok Sabha polls have only one central issue – those who support Modi vs those who do not. We have realized that Modi’s leadership transcends caste, community and geographical boundaries,” said Fadnavis.
Despite having the second-most constituencies in the country, 48, after Uttar Pradesh’s 80, Maharashtra has in the past seen four-phase Lok Sabha elections at the most. While three phases were the norm from 1962 to 2014, in 2019, the first polls announced with the Narendra Modi government at the Centre, the number of phases were increased to four.
Questioning the decision to hold polls over five phases this time, in an election that remains hard to call, NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar) president Jayant Patil said: “If the BJP is so confident of sweeping the polls, where was the need for five phases? The poll dates are planned so as to suit their campaign. It appears everything is being done to help the BJP.”
Opposition leaders point out that Maharashtra has also seen single-phase polling across 288 Assembly seats, with hardly any major incidents of violence.
Congress state chief Nana Patole said: “Our question is simple. Does Maharashtra need five-phase polls? Whom does it help? After each phase, there is a huge gap, which is clearly intended to support those in power.”
Patole claimed that this showed that the BJP was unsure of its support base. “Therefore, it has to resort to all these tactics.”
Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi president Prakash Ambedkar, who is in talks with the Opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition, said: “In 1985, when I first got into electoral politics, the elections were held in one phase. As far as I recall, a majority of the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections were confined to two phases.”
Now with EVMs, and other technological advances, there was even lesser need to stretch out the election exercise, Ambedkar said, adding that the only reason for five phases appears to be that “the BJP wants to ensure that Modi campaigns in maximum places across Maharashtra”.
Disputing the Opposition’s claims, Maharashtra party president Chandrashekhar Bawankule said, “The Election Commission decides the poll time table, the number of phases and the duration.”
For the EC, law and order would have been paramount, Bawankule said, adding that the number of phases didn’t really concern the BJP. “We are battle ready.”
The Opposition’s claims indicated that, on the other hand, it was already preparing the ground for its defeat. “By finding faults with poll dates, they have exposed their lack of confidence.”
A senior BJP functionary said: “We don’t understand the Opposition’s anger. If five phases give us more time to campaign, it holds true for them too.” Besides, the senior leader added sarcastically, it actually helps the Opposition more as they have a restricted number of star campaigners, such as Uddhav Thackeray, Sharad Pawar and Rahul Gandhi. The BJP, in contrast, has leaders who command support across, the leader said. “The Opposition leaders can use the extra time to make greater inroads. Who has stopped them?”
According to the leader, the EC’s logic seemed purely to be checking possible disturbances. Apart from Marathwada, where Maratha and OBC passions are running high and drought is another concern, the leader said, the Naxal-affected regions of Gadchiroli and Chandrapur have been slotted for voting along with eastern Vidarbha in the first phase, with Western Vidarbha casting its ballot in the second.
Phase-wise voting
April 19: Ramtek, Nagpur, Bhandara-Gondia, Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, all in Eastern Vidarbha.
April 26: Buldhana, Akola, Amravati, Wardha, Yavatmal-Washim in Vidarbha; and Hingoli, Nanded, Parbhani in Marathwada.
May 7: Osmanabad (now Dharashiv), Latur in Marathwada; Raigad, Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg in Konkan; Baramati, Solapur, Madha, Sangli, Satara in Western Maharashtra; and Kolhapur, Hatkanangle.
May 13: Nandurbar, Jalgaon, Raver, Ahmednagar, Shirdi in North Maharashtra; Jalna, Aurangabad (now Sambhajinagar), Beed in Marathwada; and Maval, Shirur, Pune in Western Maharashtra.

"R Ashwin: ‘I started weeping, locked myself in my room, wanted to quit cricket… Then I sought external help’",R Ashwin speaks on mental-health issues and how the perceptions of him being an ‘over-thinker’ affected his leadership chances. The session was moderated by Senior Assistant Editor Venkata Krishna B.,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/R-Ashwin-1.jpg?w=640,"India's R Ashwin during the award ceremony after India won the fifth Test cricket match over England, in Dharamsala, Saturday, March 9, 2024. India win the five-match series 4-1. (PTI Photo)","Why Ashwin: In the recently concluded series against England, R Ashwin, India’s leading spinner, crossed the landmarks of 100 Tests and 500 wickets. He played a big role in India beating England 4-1.
Nihal Koshie: BCCI told top cricketers that skipping domestic cricket when not on national duty would have its implications. The BCCI felt some cricketers were prioritising IPL over red- ball/domestic cricket. But when cricketers play all three formats and also take mental-health breaks, should the BCCI insist on that?
Sometimes when an organisation takes a stand, it might not suit everyone, it might not work in favour of everyone, it might be detrimental to a few people. What we must understand here is the message being conveyed by the organisational body here, it said we are prioritising Test cricket, IPL is not everything as far as we are concerned. They are saying Test cricket is of paramount importance, we are going to promote it and we expect people eligible to play this format. In my view, they are making all the right noises. At the same time, whether a cricketer wants to do all the 12 months, or only want to do the two months or whether they want to be relevant playing T20 cricket and one-day cricket and do not want to be playing Test cricket, is their choice.
Sandeep Dwivedi: Is there a trend among the younger generation of cricketers to market themselves on social media in a certain way? Like posting videos before selection day, wishing happy birthday to a certain group etc…
It’s very hard to make a complete assessment. In some cases, players don’t really handle their own social media handles. I like talking about cricket, which is why you see me on YouTube. I was always very instinctive, very upright, and somebody who loved the game to bits. And if I spoke about cricket to X, Y, or Z, I realized far later in my life that they see it as overthinking.
I would come back to my street and talk to friends about the same thing. That’s the culture I’ve been brought up in. So when I stepped out of Madras, I didn’t know what India was about. I give my opinion, but if I didn’t change my views or opinions, I wouldn’t be who I am today. Agreeing to disagree is the greatest quality one can have.
I didn’t even bother about when selections are happening. But now things have changed. There is a cricket Twitter war going on, on who should be there in the squad, what are the reasons somebody is selected. At the end of the day, we need to understand that there is a selection committee and things will have to happen according to what the team requires.
Whichever cricketer I sit around with, I tell them the same thing. PR and marketing will get you to a certain place. They might have value, but it’s only 1 percent.
Mihir Vasavda: How was it in the dressing room when you came and how is it now, especially when it comes to communication in Hindi?
It’s a cultural shock. My first shock came when I went for an Under-17 India team camp. All I had had in my life was curd rice at night. The next time I found curd rice was 45 days later. You can’t even explain that to somebody. I actually studied in Hindi but my Hindi fluency or vocabulary wasn’t good enough to speak.
It was neither’s fault. I’m a very proud Tamilian. But the first thing I would do to any child that comes to my academy is along with cricket, they should learn a bit of Hindi. Because the moment the child goes to an Under-14 or Under-16 NCA camp, the last thing you want the child to do is silently wonder what these guys are saying in Hindi behind their back. I would actually seriously recommend for people to understand that this (diversity) is the way of life and this is a beautiful country. We must embrace it.
Sriram Veera: M Vijay once said that he could never be himself in the dressing room because his sense of humour was in Tamil. How did you handle that?
I can empathise. He’s a very spirited soul but in my case, the fault was with me because you need to know which players to deal with and how. I’ve also made the effort to say ‘boss, this is who I am. I’m comfortable in my skin’. They will come around because they will also understand you. It has happened inside the Indian interesting room massively. It’s a question of maturing together. You play cricket for so many years; now Virat (Kohli) knows who I am and what sort of fun I enjoy. It’s got to a situation where he sends me jokes or links knowing exactly what I might know or enjoy. It’s the same thing with Rohit (Sharma).
Sandip G: Heard you are into chess these days. What are the other sports you follow?
I have been into a bit of online chess. I’m actually a big sports buff though looking at me physically, a lot of people think I can’t do much. I was pretty good at tennis. Not maybe the quickest around, but really, really good with my long-levers. I was pretty good at table tennis, and played a bit in the zonal sides, in ball badminton. I’m pretty good at racket sports. I can’t say I’m very good at chess, okay, for an amateur.
I watch chess a bit too, when Praggnanandhaa, Magnus Carlsen play. I watch a lot of Bobby Fischer games from the past. I follow a lot of Viswanathan Anand, his legendary duels with Gary Kasparov. I love the intricacies involved in the game.
Mihir Vasavda: Talking of intricacies, when Rohit retired out in the Super Over like you had done in the IPL, Rahul Dravid mentioned that was ‘Ashwin-level thinking’. How often do the players come to you to know about these complex situations?
All these things happen not because it’s discussed. It happens because of the execution. Somebody at the end of the day needs to have the courage to say, ‘okay, I am the guy that will receive the flak’. I still remember that day when Kings were playing Rajasthan in Jaipur. The moment that (mankading) happened, there was a huge buzz, a sort of a silence, and sort of a confusion amongst my own team. I called them into the huddle and said, ‘I know this will receive a lot of attention and flak, but I will handle it. Now, you guys get on with it and make sure we convert this into a victory.’ It shouldn’t disturb anybody else. And it turned out that we won the game. And yet again, it’s proved to me that when you put people in an uncomfortable spot, which they don’t like, they will perennially crumble. Because Rajasthan were cruising even without Jos (Buttler).
I have discussed tactical timeouts with so many captains, management, etc. they say, ‘yeah that’s a great idea’ but they’ll never do it. People talk about change, even these experts on social media who have so much advice to offer, do they get down and actually do it? Do they get their hands dirty? No, they don’t. If you do not have the courage to get yourself dirty, you will never be a part of change.
Devendra Pandey: From figuring out that Sangakkara doesn’t get LBW to off-spinners to watching videos of Williamson, Steve Smith, understanding the degree of turn on offer on different days of the Test… you have done it all. Could you explain your homework methods?
One day I was talking to Muttiah Muralitharan and he said, ‘put your batting on the back shelf a little bit and bowl a lot more. As you grow older you will learn a lot more about bowling and batting’. I found it to be interesting.
Bowling is a very conscious act because you deliver the first initial action while batting is a very subconscious act as you are reacting to something – – one is action and other is reaction. And I found when the person reacting is uncomfortable that is your first battle won. Ever since maybe 2016 or 2015 itself, I found myself in a zone to make batsmen uncomfortable at the crease. Which is why you don’t see me talking to a lot of batters. I found it peculiar that good batters want to see a bowler chatting to him and who is respecting him. Giving that space is something I always avoided.
My preparation is whether I can disturb the tempo of a batter. Whether Steve Smith would go to off-stump after ten balls or 12 balls. Whether Marnus Labuschange will try to sweep or reverse me first. Or Joe Root, when you go round the stumps in the first eight balls, he would reverse you once. There are two ways of skinning it, do I want to, stop Joe Root from reversing or do I want Root to reverse or get him out. That will depend on where Joe Root is in his career, how confident he is. Has he got a hundred in the first two Tests? Is he in confident space, is he coming from Sri Lanka after making mountains of runs? So I will try and make a plan because I want that early blood.
Sriram Veera: You had once said that the ‘overthinker’ label has stuck on you to work against you.
I didn’t understand. Everybody has unique methods. A method that’s worked for me, will not work for (Ravindra) Jadeja. The cricket community likes to keep it really simple. Unless it’s completely broken, they wouldn’t try to mend it. But I come from a school where even before it’s broken, I want to make sure I stitch it up and don’t get to a point where it’s broken. Why is it happening? That’s the question that people fail to recognise. I am addressing something before they believe I should address it. Because their journey is different and mine is different. They might get five opportunities but I will get only two. And I made peace with the fact that I will only get two.
It’s not like I change my action and tomorrow if I am leading a side, I would go to Jadeja and tell him that he should change his action. I’m not that dumb. In a way, people just assumed that that’s how it could be. They just thought he would not fit the bill as a leader and that’s quite an unfair assessment.
Sriram Veera: You had also said that if it was up to you, you would pick being a batsman instead of a bowler. Were you just emotional when you said that?
I don’t say anything just because I’m emotional. If I had a son or have daughters now who want to play cricket, I’d still make them bat, there’s no two ways about it. I’ll ask them to bowl so that they understand what a bowler thinks. Australia is the most successful cricketing country in the world. They’ve got some great batters. But consistently, they have been built by superstar bowlers for decades. They look after them. Pat Cummins was 19 or 20 when he had a stress fracture. He was looked after, was put in cotton wool, and paid his match fee for every single match he missed during that stint. He was treated like somebody who was extremely special, and Cummins has delivered results as a captain and player over the last three years. They know bowlers can win you championships. India is far from it. We do talk a lot about pitches. But batsmen have a lot more good days in India than bowlers do and even when they do have good days, they are not celebrated to the point where you inspire a youngster to say, ‘I want to bowl. I want to pick up a new ball and go’.
Sriram Veera: That general perspective is fine, but are you happy you became a bowler?
It’s destiny. Sometimes we have so much vanity that we don’t admit that destiny plays a role. Right people, right place, right advice. That’s what makes you who you are.
Forget me as being a bowler or a batter, why did I want to play cricket? I wanted to wear the Indian jersey and people to cheer for me. So that India celebrates India’s victories and they celebrate you. Indian victories were paramount, but I never knew Indian bowlers would never be paramount. I’m glad over the last decade you’ve got players, like (Jasprit) Bumrah, you’ve got players like me or Kuldeep (Yadav) who are celebrated far more than a player like Anil Kumble. I feel Kumble is the least celebrated legend of the game in this country. Zaheer Khan was a legend of this game but we didn’t celebrate him.
Venkata Krishna B: In a recent column for us, your wife Preethi had mentioned how in 2017, you went through counselling sessions. What made you seek outside help and could you talk about dealing with the pressure of playing at the highest level?
There are layers of mental health. Some people can succumb to pressure. Some are on the road all the time and can get jaded. Sometimes you are in a very dark place in your life that you want to talk to someone, and I think more often than not, people find themselves in the situation of a victim. Which is a very dangerous situation in my book.
Even though I have my family rooting for me and I can come back to my family, I cannot say a lot of things. I would say cricket, in many ways, is a corporate affair with a little bit of governmental organisational activities and attributes. Though If I come and talk with my dad about corporate stuff, he has only one line to say: It’s all politics. And that’s a very large line. And even fans end up doing the same thing. Occasionally, when I find myself in a dark spot, I have also done that a little. But it’s a very wrong thing to do because you feel somebody’s success is coming very easily. It’s not.
My wife is a wonderful listener, but she had a very young family and I was not giving her enough time. One fine day, we were having a conversation. My dad said something. And some internal affair of the house had broken down. And I said something to my dad. My dad and I fight a lot. And he eventually threw a statement “You know what? You are too upright and honest. That’s why you are getting screwed.” He made that statement and left. I am not someone who is emotive. I would like to think I am pretty strong but I just locked myself away. And then I started weeping. I was crying for a long time. I didn’t expect my dad to say that. I don’t think he even realized what he did.
I thought I am putting people in my house through a lot. I used to lock myself in the room. I never watched cricket. My room used to be dark all the time.
I decided to quit cricket. I was asking myself what would I do? And I said whatever I do in life, I would try to achieve excellence and be as good as I can be in that profession. I would probably try to do an MBA and probably be in marketing. I gave myself so many options and then thought before I make any decision, I must get crystal-clear clarity. Probably get an outsider’s view into my life. And see who I am, where I am. That’s when I sought some external help and it changed my life for the better."
"Putin warns, Russia-NATO conflict is just one step from World War 3","Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, triggering major European war",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/putin-elections.jpg?w=640,"Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks on a visit to his campaign headquarters after a presidential election in Moscow, early Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP)","Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the West on Monday that a direct conflict between Russia and the US-led NATO military alliance would mean the planet was one step away from World War Three but said hardly anyone wanted such a scenario.
The Ukraine war has triggered the deepest crisis in Moscow’s relations with the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Putin has often warned of the risks of nuclear war but says he has never felt the need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.
French President Emmanuel Macron last month said he could not rule out the deployment of ground troops in Ukraine in the future, with many Western countries distancing themselves from that while others, especially in eastern Europe, expressed support.
Asked by Reuters about the Macron remarks and the risks and possibility of a conflict between Russia and NATO, Putin quipped: “everything is possible in the modern world.”
“It is clear to everyone, that this will be one step away from a full-scale World War Three. I think hardly anyone is interested in this,” Putin told reporters after winning the biggest ever landslide in post-Soviet Russian history.
Putin added, though, that NATO military personnel were present already in Ukraine, saying that Russia had picked up both English and French being spoken on the battlefield.
“There is nothing good in this, first of all for them, because they are dying there and in large numbers,” he said.
BUFFER ZONE
Ahead of the March 15-17 Russian election, Ukraine stepped up attacks against Russia, shelling border regions and even used proxies to try to pierce Russia’s borders.
Asked if he considered it necessary to take Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, Putin said if the attacks continued, Russia would create a buffer zone out of more Ukrainian territory to defend Russian territory.
“I do not exclude that, bearing in mind the tragic events taking place today, we will be forced at some point, when we deem it appropriate, to create a certain ‘sanitary zone’ in the territories today under the Kyiv regime,” Putin said.
He declined to give any further details but said such a zone might have to be big enough to preclude foreign made armaments from reaching Russian territory.
Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, triggering major European war after eight years of conflict in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian forces on one side and pro-Russian Ukrainians and Russian proxies on the other.
Putin said he wished Macron would stop seeking to aggravate the war in Ukraine but to play a role in finding peace: “It seems that France could play a role. All is not lost yet.”
“I’ve been saying it over and over again and I’ll say it again. We are for peace talks, but not just because the enemy is running out of bullets,” Putin said.
“If they really, seriously, want to build peaceful, good-neighbourly relations between the two states in the long term, and not simply take a break for rearmament for 1.5-2 years.”
US DEMOCRACY
Putin dismissed US and Western criticism of the election, which the White House said was not free and fair, saying US elections were not democratic and criticising the use of state power against Donald Trump.
“The whole world is laughing at what is happening there,” Putin said of the United States. “It is just a catastrophe – it is not democracy – what on earth is it?”
When asked about the fate of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in unexplained circumstances at a Russian prison in the Arctic on Feb. 16, Putin said he had simply “passed away” using Navalny’s name for one of the first times in public.
Putin said he had agreed several days before Navalny’s death to swap him. Reuters reported in February that a prisoner exchange deal had been agreed for Navalny shortly before his death.
“I said: ‘I am agreed’,” Putin said about his approval for the prisoner swap. “I had one condition – we exchange him but he never returns.”
Navalny’s widow, Yulia, has accused Putin of killing her husband. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that claim was simply wrong."
UPSC Ethics Simplified | Conscience and Ethical Decision making: The Caselet,How does police officer act as a 'conscience keeper' in a situation of crisis? Nanditesh Nilay narrates a case and provides some Post-Read Questions for your Ethics paper for UPSC CSE.,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/WhatsApp-Image-2024-03-17-at-14.31.26.jpeg?w=640,"""We have to act as a conscience keeper in the middle of a crisis. And we have to be a person of perseverance too.""","UPSC Ethics Simplified draws your attention to a topic of greed and desire in the form of a caselet. This caselet is an extension of the concept discussed on March 3 (Conscience and Ethical Decision Making: The Concept). It is advised to revisit the concept article before reading the caselet below.
Relevance: The topic is a part of UPSC CSE General Studies Paper-IV Ethics syllabus. Concepts are particularly relevant in the theory section. Aspirants will also find the article useful for their Essay paper and situation-based questions in personality tests. Moreover, the essence of the article will help aspirants in their professional lives or in life in general.
Nanditesh Nilay writes for UPSC Ethics Simplified fortnightly on Sundays. The first article will be a concept while the second article will be a caselet based on the concept.
He was surrounded by a mob that day, and even as a policeman, he had never dealt with such a violent situation. He was new to force. A large group of people were looking frenzy for a man from a different community. They were shouting violently and things were going out of control. The name of the police officer was Sahas Singh.
That day, sun’s rays were vertical  and he was profusely sweating. He was able to hold the person despite his sweating palm.
“Don’t worry. I am here to save you. Please don’t think anything negative,” Sahas said. But the man was trembling. “They will kill me, sir. My fault is that I am from a different community,” the man cried.
“See my face too. I am also not from your community. And this is not my duty hour. I am on leave. Still, I didn’t find any crisis of conscience within because I am always close to my conscience. It is guiding me to save your life. You are a human being for me. Nothing more, nothing less,” Sahas Singh shouted. Meanwhile, they were being pushed and abused by the mob.
Sahas was remembering the words of his teacher on the last day of school, “Sahas, lead your life with the voice of conscience. You have to act as a conscience keeper. Don’t let the environment arrest your purpose of living. Conscience is everything, Sahas, and in a world where mankind is hit badly by class, caste, religion, work pressure, greed, selfishness, arrogance, ego, and fear, you have to listen to that pure voice of duty and humanity. That can only be done if you are well prepared to face the blowing wind of a crisis that wants to blow your conscience.”
Sahas was standing tall. He replied, “I will never let you down, sir. Wherever I am, my actions and my conduct will be like those of a trustee of conscience. I am and I will be your conscience keeper, sir.”
At this moment, Sahas tightly held the boy’s hand and yelled, “You can not do any harm to him till the time I am here with him. For all of you, he is not a human but a lesser mortal, and that is because you all are also not above your community. Is your God different from my God or his God? Listen to your conscience.”
With this, Sahas began running with that person towards an incoming police van, and finally succeeded in saving the person’s life.
1. You have to act as a conscience keeper. What does this mean with reference to the caselet?
2. Evaluate the role of Sahas from ethical and professional perspectives.
3. What is the importance of the voice of conscience in your life? Had you been in the above situation, what values would have been on test along with the crisis of conscience? 
We have to act as a conscience keeper in the middle of a crisis, and we have to be a person of perseverance too. Perseverance is continued persistence in doing what one considers to be right despite difficulties or delays in achieving the desired results. It implies unwavering steadfastness in pursuing the right course of action, even in the face of odds/obstacles/pressures or failures. In dealing with public affairs such situations are not uncommon and therefore perseverance is a valuable attribute to be successful in the long run.

"As his second Yatra ends, Rahul Gandhi clearly has come a distance – but what about his party?","He has emerged as a symbol for those opposed to Modi, especially minorities, attracted crowds and earned political gravitas. But for INDIA, and even Congress, Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra was a missed opportunity.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/pm-modi-patnaik-8.jpg?w=640,"Through his two Yatras, over the last two years, first from South to North and more recently from East to West, Rahul has gained a national profile. (Express Photo by Vishal Srivastav)","Paradoxically, Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra ended the same day as the Election Commission announced the Lok Sabha polls for 2024, though the Yatra’s final rally is to take place in Mumbai on Sunday at the historic Shivaji Park.
It will now get converted into the first election meeting by the Opposition INDIA bloc in Maharashtra, which has acquired an importance all its own for both sides.
Through his two Yatras, over the last two years, first from South to North and more recently from East to West, Rahul has gained a national profile. Position or no position, he is today recognised as THE leader of the Congress who is taking decisions for the party, no matter who is in-charge officially.
He has also become a symbol for all those dissatisfied with the Narendra Modi rule. And the first choice of the minorities —wherever the Congress is in a position to get its act together.
Last Friday, at the Muslim-dominated powerloom city of Bhiwandi in Thane district, a crowd of 7,000-10,000 of mainly Muslims waited for him to arrive from Palghar for the last lap of his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, even though it was time to break their Ramzan roza. Speaker after speaker from the community urged those present to work to make Rahul the prime minister. As they milled round the Anant Dighe Chowk, they nostalgically recalled the Congress rule and the “mohabbat (harmony)” of earlier years!
The curiosity about Rahul has also increased in the last two years; people want to know more about him. At Bhiwandi, I found a large group of Hindu women who had come with their children. “We wanted to see for ourselves what he is like”, “We had heard about him”. Would they be voting for him? “We will vote for whoever works for us.”
Rahul has also emerged as the sharpest critic of Modi today. He did not mince his words two days ago while criticising the PM, calling the now-scrapped electoral bonds scheme the biggest “extortion” undertaken at the behest of Modi.
Over the last two years, Rahul has become more confident in the way he handles questions from the media; on electoral bonds, he remained determinedly focused on his subject, not letting the media deflect him by raising issues around the Congress’s culpability in other matters. (Still, he continues to berate the media at every opportunity he gets!)
Congress workers also noted that between the two Yatras, Rahul did not disappear abroad as frequently as he used to earlier.
By design or default, in the way the situation has developed, and without being officially projected as the alternative to Modi either by his own party or by the Opposition alliance, it is Rahul who is seen as the counter to Modi in the battle that now lies ahead for the Delhi gaddi.
Rahul Gandhi’s Yatra-1 was a novel, innovative idea. People responded positively to a politician, and that too the “Prince-like” scion of the Nehru Gandhi family, walking 4,000 km to come to them and listen to them. He stayed the course and the whole exercise helped him shed his non-serious, so-called “Pappu” image.
Though Rahul continued with the faux pas he is known for, such as a negative reference to V D Savarkar in Maharashtra, a state where he is a respected figure, during his first Yatra. This time, there was much heartburn within the Congress over his contemptuous reference to those who attended the Ayodhya Ram Temple consecration, saying it only had “people like Ambani, Adani” or a “dancing” Aishwarya Rai.
The second Yatra, particularly its timing, was also mystifying. Elections were around the corner, seat-sharing had to be finetuned with coalition partners; new challenges faced the INDIA bloc, with Mamata Banerjee pulling out, as did the Jayant Choudhary-led RLD. And a Yatra on wheels was like so many other such endeavours, with politicians undertaking tours all the time, interspersed with small group meetings.
Still, as during his first Yatra, Rahul drew large crowds in some places, such as in Nashik earlier this week where, as per a Congress leader, “Bhayankar response tha (There was huge response)”. The Communists have had a base in the region, and ally Shiv Sena also put its best foot forward.
But, at the end of the day, the Yatras have done little to rebuild a dying Congress organisation. There could have been follow-up camps across the country, along the routes Rahul followed, tapping into the enthusiasm and new energies generated by his Yatra to create a support base for his party. Even when people talk of the good response Rahul drew in some places, they express in the next breath what worries most Congress karyakartas, “But we don’t know if this will convert into votes!”
An organisation is a necessary prerequisite for garnering votes. And ultimately, a political party is all about power and winning elections – before it can get on to “serving the people”, or “changing policy” or “protecting democracy”.
It was towards the end of his Yatra-2, particularly after he entered Maharashtra, a state which is going to decide fortunes in the coming elections, that Rahul struck a poll pitch, and announced ‘Nyay’ / guarantees for farmers, youth and women like agenda points for his party’s manifesto. He also shared the stage with NCP (SP) supremo Sharad Pawar and Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut in Nashik, giving it the flavour of the INDIA bloc fighting the polls together.
Rahul’s Yatra-2, many feel, could have been more of the above – about the INDIA alliance, and less about himself, signalling, as nothing else could have done, the coalition getting ready for the 2024 polls, moving in step from state to state. But the allies were not consulted, and they were made part of the journey only at the last moment, as in UP and later in Maharashtra. It was an opportunity lost.
“India is at a point today, not unlike the situation it faced in 1947”, said an entrepreneur in Pune, “to be or not to be inclusive.” Rahul raised the right issues, the entrepreneur added, “par woh unki pakad mein nahin aa rahe hain (but he is not able to convey the same to connect with the people)”.
This was also true of issues such as “berozgari (unemployment)” – a reality for so many. Selling cucumbers from a cart at a chowk in Thane, Vikas Kumar said he had come all the way to Mumbai from Poorvi Champaran in search of work. “I have to pay Rs 4,000 per month to the policeman, eke out a living and send money to my ailing mother back home,” says the 20-year-old OBC youth.
Rahul’s posters around him, Vikas says he has heard about the Yatra. But the ideas espoused by Rahul, including caste census, language that suggests the Congress leader sees himself in the role of Mandal Messiah-2 – his constant refrain that “90% of India (OBCs, SCs, STs, minorities) does not figure among the top positions in the country’s bureaucracy, judiciary, or the media” – do not resonate with Vikas.
But now the die has been cast. Rahul’s opponent is no ordinary foe – pitching as Modi is for 370 seats this time. There will now be no time for anything but hard bargaining across the table for seats, and the heat and dust of a long, gruelling campaign spread over seven phases.
It is once again over to the people of India.

Tavleen Singh writes: Electoral bonds failed to bring transparency or end black money,This scheme that turned ‘black’ money snowy white as soon as it became a political donation was ‘not perfect’ as the finance minister admitted at the India Today conclave last week.,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Of-elections-and-bonds_Premium-01.jpg?w=640,Congress Party spokesmen are taking a high moral tone on the issue and tarring the BJP. (Representational Image),"One of the things I do not like being called is a ‘veteran journalist’. It makes me feel ancient. But I have no hesitation in admitting that I have been around in journalism for a very long time and that this has its advantages. It has enabled me to bear witness to a lot of history and a lot of elections and it has made me learn how to view political events and changes from a vantage point of some distance. This could be why I see the electoral bonds scheme with a degree of perspective. Do not get me wrong. I have no intention of defending this dangerously deceptive scheme. I am very happy that the Supreme Court demanded answers and forced the names of donors to political parties to be revealed along with their donations.
This scheme that turned ‘black’ money snowy white as soon as it became a political donation was ‘not perfect’ as the finance minister admitted at the India Today conclave last week. But she was right when she reminded the audience that the system that existed before was much worse. It might have been more accurate to say that it did nothing to improve corrupt practices from times of yore.
I remember elections in the seventies and eighties, and even in more recent times, when powerful politicians were able to coerce industrialists to make huge donations with the promise that if they won, they would ensure payback. Stashes of cash continue to be found regularly in the homes of politicians and their associates which means the practice is thriving. Money is concealed this way because it is usually dirty money. The election bonds were supposedly an attempt to make political donations more transparent, but this did not happen. The bonds failed to bring transparency or end black money which is what they were created to do. But they provided a useful cover for political parties who wanted to appear to have hands too clean to touch black money.
Congress Party spokesmen are taking a high moral tone on the issue and tarring the BJP. Hypocrites. Have they forgotten their own grubby history? In the seventies and eighties when elections came, Delhi’s political grapevine would buzz with rumours of ‘suitcases of cash’ coming from the Soviet Union. Nobody ever confirmed if this was true or not but many years later, when KGB spymaster Vasili Mitrokhin wrote his memoirs, he mentioned casually that several members of Indira Gandhi’s cabinet were on the KGB payroll. Mitrokhin’s revelations were damning and should have caused a furor in India. This did not happen because nobody seemed really surprised.
Anyone with the smallest interest in the Indian political system knows well that our elections are funded by money donated by rich businessmen and that often these donations are linked to a contract or a favour. What is worrying about the donations made through the election bonds is that some of them seem to have been made to evade environmental clearances. Others seem to have been made by people who feared that they were on the verge of being raided by the Enforcement Directorate or the Income Tax department.
It is not easy to break the symbiotic relationship that exists all over the world between big money and big politics but in countries that have better checks and balances things work better. If India’s political system continues to be reliant on black money it is mostly the fault of our political leaders. If they made it easier for businessmen to work without needing to rely on bribery and corruption there would be less black money. The question we need to be asking is why this has not already happened, and the answer could be that it suits our politicians to fund their elections with hidden resources.
The electoral bonds were an attempt to conceal this ugly truth rather than an honest attempt to bring transparency into the political system and this is why the Supreme Court has expressed its disapproval so strongly. So, will things change some day soon? The sad truth is that this is unlikely because what happens at the very top of our political system also happens at the very bottom. In rural India people talk openly about how their local leaders never let go of their position until they can give it to a relative because politics has become such a lucrative business. When they contest elections, they do it on other people’s money and not their own. This they use to build themselves big houses and buy their family big cars.
The Supreme Court’s resolve to lift the veils that concealed the names of the people who bought those election bonds and the names of the parties who benefited from them is a vital first step towards change. But, for real change to happen there will need to be a total cleansing of our political culture. When Narendra Modi first became prime minister one of his first ‘guarantees’ was that he would end black money. If he becomes prime minister for the third term, we must hope that he will deliver on this promise because there is no question that things need to change if India is to ever become a developed country.
Countries whose elections are fueled by black money usually remain trapped in the swamp and miasma that corrupt political systems wallow in forever."
"Three years since inception, here’s how Delhi’s Specialised Schools of Excellence are faring","In Aam Aadmi Party-ruled Punjab too, where the party had pitched the ‘Delhi model’ of education during the 2022 Assembly polls in the state, similar specialised schools, called ‘Schools of Eminence’, are being set up.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/delhi-schools.jpg?w=640,Students attend Robotics course at the School of Special Learning (SOSE) Rohini in New Delhi on Friday. (Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal),"Is this a board exam, wondered an autorickshaw driver, as anxious parents, some with school bags slung over their shoulders, and children, crowded around the gate of Delhi government’s School of Specialised Excellence (SoSE) in Kalkaji one morning in the middle of February.
The school’s security guard allowed students in one by one for what was not a board exam, but a group discussion — which forms the second round of testing for admission to the humanities course for classes 9 and 11 at Delhi’s SoSEs.
Sitting in a classroom with four other students for the discussion that day, on “whether social media is destroying creativity”, Doli, who was applying to Class 9, spoke about the problem of cyberbullying and loneliness from excessive social media use. She was studying at a private school in Sangam Vihar that offered classes only till Grade 8. “… With the financial position at home, one of my teachers said I could apply to one of these government schools that are good,” said Doli, whose father is a driver and mother a housewife. She intends to take the UPSC exam eventually.
Also part of the discussion was Darshana Sakla; her take was that social media could be useful, entertaining, and “increase the capability to think”. She too was in a private school in Tigri Extension that offered classes only till Grade 8. “The first admission round, a test, went well…,” said Darshana, whose father is associated with scrap recycling.
The two girls are among 1,44,200 applicants seeking admission to the 38 SoSEs — the government’s showpiece schools, rich in facilities and with small class sizes — for the upcoming academic year. This is 24 times the number of seats — around 6,000 — likely to be up for grabs in these schools. There are five streams on offer, from STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and Humanities to ‘High-End 21st Century Skills’ (HE-21) which teaches robotics, graphic design and coding. There is also a specific stream to prepare one to get into the NDA, taught at the Armed Forces Preparatory School. The fifth is Performing and Visual Arts.
In Aam Aadmi Party-ruled Punjab too, where the party had pitched the ‘Delhi model’ of education during the 2022 Assembly polls in the state, similar specialised schools, called ‘Schools of Eminence’, are being set up.
The Indian Express visited two schools in Delhi, at Kalkaji and Rohini, and spoke to students and teachers to understand how they are faring.
What’s on offer
Since they were set up three years ago in 2021-22, the number of students applying to SoSEs has increased. This year for Class 9, STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) has received the most applications — at 37,960 — while Humanities is the second most popular. In Class 11, the highest number of applications this time was for STEM — 28,135. (see box).
The application influx for STEM in Class 11 could have to do with the assistance provided for crucial entrance exams like NEET and JEE: SoSEs offering this stream have Vidyamandir Classes as a knowledge partner, while sessions and time-bound papers are offered for competitive exam preparation.
Class 11 student Aashray Kumar, who moved to the Kalkaji SoSE — which offers STEM and humanities — from a private school, said, “I enjoy math and science. The fees in my old school were high… I learnt about the SoSE during the pandemic. Here, coaching and school go together…” Kumar lives in Govindpuri and hopes to pursue a BTech programme. His father is a home tutor.
Ayushi, also a Class 11 student who moved to the SoSE from another government school, said: “This school is better… there are more and better labs. There are workshops too; we had one recently on intellectual property rights.” Her father is an auto driver.

For some students, it isn’t just about the infrastructure, but also the specialisations themselves.
Khushi Chaudhry, a Class 11 student at the SoSE in Rohini Sector 11, which offers the HE-21 stream, moved here from a private one with this particular specialisation in mind. “During Covid, we would have online classes and take exams. It was like being trapped. Then I came across branding and graphic designing and heard about SoSEs. Science would have been a safer option, but HE-21 struck me as something different. It was difficult to adapt in the beginning… but I was able to explore graphic design… the course teaches you how to use design tools,” she said.
Chaudhry is learning digital media design, one of six specialised courses offered in the stream. The others are robotics, coding, fashion, finance and accounting, and electromechanical production. While students get to try all six in classes 9 and 10, they choose one for classes 11 and 12.

Of the 82 students in Class 11 in the school, 20 chose coding, while 10 picked robotics. The finance and accounting course, which includes aspects of investing, was the most popular, with 27 students.
The Rohini school also offers several facilities: Chromebooks, iPads, and Mac desktops for students and smart classrooms.
At the school’s digital media design lab in February, students were working on their Chromebooks and iPads on branding for tourist spots in Delhi — figuring out how to design brochures and an app for locations like Safdarjung Tomb. They were learning with a special resource person from IIT-Delhi, which is a ‘knowledge partner’ with the HE-21 SoSEs, along with NIFT Delhi which provides a resource person for the fashion specialisation. The ‘knowledge partners’ provide support with curriculum design and resource persons.
The school also has six labs; the robotics and electromechanical production ones in particular are equipped with sensors, micro-controllers, electrical circuits, and equipment for soldering and welding.
For Md Shaan Serwal, a Class 11 student who picked robotics, the lab is of great help since equipment is difficult to come by elsewhere. “I might still be able to figure out coding online. (But for robotics)… we get components and hardware (in school)… I will need both robotics and coding for game development, which I want to do later,” said Serwal, who moved to the SoSE from a government school.
Aman Khushwaha, a class 9 student working with a group to put a small car together in one of the labs, said he wanted to join a Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya after his sister had done well at one such school, but admissions had stopped. He picked the SoSE instead, hoping to study coding and robotics.
The new system, meanwhile, saw its share of apprehensions.
Class 11 student Harshita Gupta, specialising in digital media design at the Rohini SoSE, moved from a private school. “What fascinated me was the specialised subjects. I didn’t want to do humanities or science… Some of my relatives said this whole system was an experiment and we were going to be guinea pigs… my mother too didn’t want me to join here since the idea is that private schools are better. But we decided to apply anyway,” said the 16-year-old, whose father is a tuition teacher.
Said school principal Vipin Kumar, “This is all new… HE-21 was new to us too when it was introduced in 2021. Even parents are becoming more aware, slowly.”
He added that of the 288 students in his school — 178 boys and 110 girls — around 40% are likely to be from private schools.
Incidentally, only a small fraction of students in Delhi have access to such sought-after facilities — 8,107 students were enrolled in SoSEs in 2023-24, when the total number of students in 1,039 Delhi government schools was 17.85 lakh in 2022-23.
Flexible curriculum
SoSEs are affiliated with the Delhi Board of School Education (DBSE), introduced in 2021 with a focus on “understanding and learning rather than scoring marks by rote learning”. It has partnered with the International Baccalaureate (IB), a private international education board, to implement its programmes, including assessment and teaching methods.
“The idea is to offer skill-based education. Not everybody might want to pursue higher education after Class 12… DBSE provides for a continuous assessment system. This can make sure exam fever is limited,” Principal Kumar said.
The curriculum can also be flexible, he added: “Teachers participate in deciding course content and there are co-creation workshops. DBSE has a curriculum team, and knowledge partners are also involved. Before each unit, teachers can decide on additions and rectifications in the unit. So, the curriculum may change as per need.”
While it offers more options to students, DBSE has been different for teachers as well, said Vineeta Mathur, PGT (postgraduate teacher) computer science, who teaches coding at the Rohini school.
Preeti Sharma, who teaches English, said, “The curriculum is different, and we need to prepare for it. Students, for example, are learning to hold interviews; the curriculum is based on application more than just theory.”
Foundational subjects like English and Mathematics are taught at the SoSEs, depending on the stream.
According to Suman Taneja, Principal at the Kalkaji SoSE, which has 528 students, with a maximum of 30 in one section, the assessment is not percentage-based: “In classes 9 and 10, there are descriptors and grade points… Pen-and-paper tests happen at the end of the term. After each unit plan, there is a unit end assessment.” She added: “Parents are usually confused that there is no percentage, no ranking. We have an orientation for them in Class 9.”

"In Lok Sabha polls 2024, Congress hopes for a repeat of 2004, stares at heartland challenge","Congress party has been struggling to build a narrative that BJP can be defeated and that INDIA bloc can be its credible alternative, with the latter yet to come up with a common roadmap.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/pm-modi-patnaik-3.jpg?w=640,The Congress hopes Rahul’s Yatras -- the second one centered around the theme of “Nyay” -- have struck a chord with the people. (Express file photo by Amit Mehra),"Rahul Gandhi has walked the extra mile, while his party Congress has swallowed pride and joined a band of disparate Opposition parties to stop the Narendra Modi juggernaut and announced, perhaps for the first time, a raft of poll promises even before the election schedule was announced.
Despite these unprecedented political moves, the Congress is entering the Lok Sabha battlefield with just a flicker of hope of a repeat of the 2004 verdict.
Its grand plan to ensure that there is one Opposition candidate against the BJP in 400 plus Lok Sabha seats has not fully materialised — there will still be Opposition coalitions in several states — and the INDIA alliance has struggled to sustain its momentum after its much-hyped launch in Patna last year largely because of internal divisions and bickerings besides some high-profile exits.
The Congress is also entering the Lok Sabha campaign perhaps with a sense of deja vu.
In 2019, its campaign had two broad themes — the “chowkidar chor hai” line of attack against Prime Minister Modi over the Rafale fighter jet deal, and the ambitious promise of a minimum income guarantee to the poor, or NYAY as it was called. And now, with the party having revived NYAY, revelations about the nature of anonymous contributions to political parties through electoral bonds will form the dual core of its attack.
The grand old party has added one more layer — a relentless pitch for a caste census and the talk of representation for the OBCs, Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST). The Congress hopes that its OBC, tribal and Dalit gambit will have a resonance, and its welfare promises would strike a chord. The party believes there is “silent anger” brewing against the BJP government among the youth over lack of jobs and among the lower middle class and poor families because of the rise in the cost of living.
But the main Opposition party appears has been struggling to build a political discourse and narrative that the BJP can be defeated and that the INDIA bloc can be its credible alternative. The faltering alliance is yet to come up with a common programme, or articulate a clear governance agenda. Not even once have the alliance partners managed to bring all its top leaders together on one single public platform. The best case scenario, for many in the Congress, is a repeat of a 2004-like verdict, when the BJP’s “India Shining” campaign had come a cropper.
With Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) and Jayant Chaudhary’s RLD walking out of the INDIA bloc and Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress (TMC) all but snapping ties with it, the alliance no longer looks formidable and perhaps lacks a national appeal. The Samajwadi Party (SP)-Congress alliance in Uttar Pradesh and the AAP-Congress seat sharing arrangement in Delhi have come as just cold comfort to it. There will, of course, be seat sharing pacts in Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Maharashtra and Jharkhand — those alliances pre-date the formation of the INDIA bloc.
The Congress hopes Rahul’s Yatras — the second one centered around the theme of “Nyay” — have struck a chord with the people. The promises it has announced so far are tailored for and focused on the unemployed youth, women, tribals, Dalits, the working class and the farmers, and dovetail into the larger theme of justice — social, economic and political.
North India, however, remains the Achilles heel for the Congress. The party believes it would perform well in Kerala and Telangana, manage to halve the BJP’s tally in Karnataka and sweep Tamil Nadu along with the senior partner DMK.
The Congress was decimated in the Hindi heartland both in 2014 and 2019, resulting in the party plunging to its all time low tally of 44 in 2014 and 52 in the last Lok Sabha elections.
In 2019, the Congress could win only one each in Uttar Pradesh (Sonia Gandhi in Rae Bareli), Bihar (Kishanganj) and Madhya Pradesh (Chhindwara), which account for 149 seats. It could not open its account in Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. It won two seats in Chhattisgarh and one in Jharkhand. So the party had won just 6 of the 225 Lok Sabha seats spread across 10 states in the heartland.
While the Pulwama attack and the Balakot strike had derailed the Congress momentum in 2019, the party this time is facing a Hindutva-nationalism cocktail in the form of the Ram temple consecration, abrogation of Article 370 and talk around CAA.
The big question is whether the Congress would be able to make a comeback in the Hindi speaking states, where the BJP hopes the consecration of the Ram Temple at Ayodhya will have a huge appeal. Added to that would be the BJP’s poll pitch around the CAA, Sanatan Dharma and the UCC. The Congress or the INDIA bloc have no counter-narrative to the BJP on these issues — the only argument made by Rahul had been about the star-studded guest list at the Temple opening and the lack of commoners there.
The Congress now has spent its longest time out of power — surpassing its eight-year stint in political wilderness from 1996 to 2004. The party has its formidable task cut out to tide over its existential crisis and touch the three-digit mark in the upcoming polls.
In a break from past, the Congress has this time named 82 candidates even before the announcement of the poll dates. Also, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) is meeting on March 19 to approve its poll manifesto."
"History Headline: Kochrab Ashram, where Gandhi became the Mahatma",The recently renovated Ashram is where Gandhi started planning his 'war against the British' and where he began his experiments with truth,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Gandhis-experiments-with-truth-at-Kochrab_Premium-01.jpg?w=640,"Barrister Jivanlal Desai let out his “vacation home”, a European-style bungalow with a large garden, in Kochrab village, then on the outskirts of Ahmedabad on the banks of the Sabarmati river, to Gandhi. (Express photo by Nirmal Harindran)","The staff at barrister Jivanlal Desai’s house, Jivan Nivas, would wonder why their guest — a wiry man who had returned from South Africa — spent most of his time at home, while their boss was at work.
“In a bid to end the chatter, the guest, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi told them one day, ‘I am not idle. I am thinking about how to start a war against the British’,” says Desai’s grandson Shailesh Diwan, 86, narrating an account that has passed down in the family since 1915.
According to Diwan, Desai and Gandhi had studied law together in London. On his return from South Africa, Gandhi stayed at Desai’s bungalow in the now-crowded Kalupur area which is near the railway station.
A ‘vacation home’ that became Bapu’s first ashram in India
Desai later let out his “vacation home”, a European-style bungalow with a large garden, in Kochrab village, then on the outskirts of Ahmedabad on the banks of the Sabarmati river, to Gandhi. It was here that the Mahatma would start his first ashram, the Satyagraha Ashram, in India, on May 25, 1915, and begin his experiments with truth.
Diwan and his wife Gita visited the bungalow standing in a 5000-sq metre plot, on March 13 this year, to relive old memories. A day earlier, PM Narendra Modi had inaugurated the renovated Kochrab ashram virtually, while laying the foundation of the Gandhi Ashram Memorial and Precinct Development Project in Ahmedabad’s Gandhi ashram.
“Since both did not believe in freebies, my grandfather and Gandhi decided on annual rent — Re 1 — for the Kochrab house,” says Diwan, who has recently moved to Ahmedabad from Mumbai.
A plaque on the bungalow’s wall says Morarji Desai, then the Chief Minister of Bombay who would later become the Prime Minister, declared the “historic and pure” ashram in Kochrab a memorial on October 4, 1953, five years after Gandhi’s assassination. In 1954, while Morarji Desai was the Chancellor of Gujarat Vidyapith, the varsity founded by Gandhi in Ahmedabad, the ashram’s management was handed over to the Vidyapith, though its ownership remained with the state.
The two-storey building’s thick walls plastered with limestone and the wooden ceiling resting on varnished logs offer much-needed respite from the blazing Ahmedabad sun. During a tour, Bhim Bahadur, 44, the caretaker of 22 years, unlocks the aged but strong iron latches on each of the solid wood doors to the rooms and flips the antique black switches, each of them working.
The ground floor, surrounded by a verandah, has rooms used by Gandhi, Kasturba, the other inmates and for storage. A wooden staircase leads to the top floor, which has a low-seating conference room and a library with wooden flooring. While the ground floor has bathrooms, the first floor has a spacious balcony.
Bahadur says everything in the house is over 100 years old, including the wooden blinds on doors. A heavy brass bell hangs from the ornate eaves of the upstairs balcony. “This was rung to ensure everyone was up at 4 am, came down for prayers by 5.30 am, had meals on time and went to bed by 9 pm,” says Bahadur, who belongs to Nepal.
A separate single-storey building on the rear side is a kitchen, with a roof made of “imported tiles”. It also has a storeroom, toilets and bathrooms. “The small room used as a store has a large cupboard, so big that it cannot pass through the door which suggests it was built inside this room and dates back to Gandhiji’s time,” says a booklet on the ashram by Ramesh Trivedi, a retired Vidyapith teacher who looked after the ashram for over 18 years, before relocating to Canada.
Another longish building, Paanch Ordiyo (five rooms), on the premises was used for activities like weaving and carpentry. The newest addition at the Kochrab premise is an Activities Centre, built in modern design, with around 10 rooms on the top floor, including four air-conditioned ones that are named after various ashram inmates, including Dudhabhai Dafda, a Dalit weaver whose family Gandhi took into the ashram causing outrage among some inmates.
While the Diwan family is not too happy with the contrast this building poses against the original buildings, they are happy it has been restored and renovated, in an “as was” condition.
The earthquake on January 26, 2001, caused immense damage to the building. Trivedi was posted at the ashram around that time by the then Vidyapith Vice-Chancellor. He took charge of the repairs with government funds, including replacing the broken Kota stone floor in Gandhi’s room with a mirror-polished version.
“We are happy that nothing has changed in the building after the latest renovation. Otherwise, what is the point?” says Diwan.
When Gandhi would stopped by for a chat
Historian Rizwan Kadri, who lives in his ancestral home at Kagdiwad, a stone’s throw from the ashram, is among those who pushed the authorities for the upkeep of the ashram. He says his grandfather Nooruddin Kadri came to Kochrab, which lies on the west bank of the Sabarmati, in 1910 from Raikhad, on the east bank, “to get away from the crowd”. The family came to be known as the ‘Bootwala family’ since they owned the Gujarat Boothouse.
Kadri says, “On the way to the Sabarmati river, Gandhi would often stop by at our house to chat with my grandfather.”
Mahatma-ni Parikrama (The path of the Mahatma), a book Kadri wrote, inspired by notes from Gandhi’s diary that are preserved at the National Gandhi Museum in Delhi, has details of how Gandhi and Kasturba did a vastu puja at the Kochrab Ashram on May 20, 1915, before moving in. On the ashram’s centenary, Kadri had organised an event, along with the Swaminarayan Gadi Sansthan, Maninagar, to release his book on Gandhi and Lokmanya Tilak.
Over the years, however, the Kochrab ashram became a victim of neglect. “Luxury buses would remain parked outside, creating a mess, even as the ashram would remain mostly closed,” says Kadri.
At least 15-30 feet of the ashram’s front space was taken for the expansion of Ashram Road, an arterial road in Ahmedabad, in lieu of compensatory land on the rear side.
Showing pictures of the decorated ashram on March 12, 2024, which also marked the 94th anniversary of the Dandi March, after PM Modi inaugurated it virtually, Bahadur told The Indian Express, “Iss mitti ko aap sar par rakkho. Jo kaam tay kiya hai, woh zaroor hoga. Utna power hai iss jagah ka (pick up the earth here and place it on your head. Whatever task you have set out to achieve, will be successful. Such is the power of this place).”
“Earlier he (PM) was to come here, but he inaugurated it digitally. Maybe because the ashram is in a crowded part of the city and would have inconvenienced people,” he rues.
A series of wall panels quoting from his autobiography, The Story of My Experiments with Truth, tell the story of the ashram under Gandhi. A panel states how many friends convinced Gandhi to choose Ahmedabad over Haridwar and Rajkot where he did his schooling.
Kadri’s book says it was Ahmedabad-based Dr Hariprasad Desai among those who convinced Gandhi to choose the city during the Mahatma’s first visit to Ahmedabad in January 1915.
“I had a predilection for Ahmedabad. Being a Gujarati, I thought I should be able to render greatest service to the country through the Gujarati language. And then, as Ahmedabad was an ancient centre of handloom weaving, it was likely to be the most favourable field for the revival of the cottage industry of hand spinning. There was also the hope that the city being the capital of Gujarat monetary help from its wealthy citizens would be more available here than elsewhere,” Gandhi writes in his autobiography.
The panels also clarify why he chose the name Satyagraha Ashram instead of ‘Sevashram’ or ‘Tapovan’, as suggested by others. His autobiography explains, “…I wanted to acquaint India with the method I had tried in South Africa, and I desired to test in India the extent to which its application might be possible so the name Satyagraha Ashram to convey goal and method of service”.
According to Kadri’s book, when Gandhi decided to settle in Ahmedabad, “he transformed the ashram into an antithesis of everything Ahmedabad stood for in those days. Here was a city of moneyed mill owners who lived a life of opulence. In stark contrast, the Satyagraha Ashram at Kochrab was defined by austerity”.
The ashram started with 25 men and women, 13 of them Tamilians, who had accompanied Gandhi back from South Africa. The ashram took in children as young as four years old, with their parents’ consent. The strength grew to about 100 inmates, including Vinoba Bhave and Dattatreya Balkrishna Kalelkar, an activist from the freedom movement, in the two years that Gandhi occupied it.
A Dalit family comes to the ashram
On September 11, 1915, in a hit on untouchability — which he considered a “blot” on the country — Gandhi took Dudhabhai, a Dalit weaver and his family, into the ashram. Initially, there were vehement protests by the inmates, including Kasturba.
“This upset a neighbouring community and even Vaishnav businessmen refused to fund Gandhiji’s activities. Bapu (Gandhiji) told the ashram inmates that if a boycott was declared and they were left without funds, they would shift to the untouchable’s colony. One morning, a wealthy businessman from Ahmedabad anonymously donated Rs 13,000 to the ashram,” writes Kadri, adding that many believe the benefactor was textile baron Ambalal Sarabhai.
Kadri co-relates dates from Gandhi’s diary, where a note on September 17, 1915, states that “Ambalal Sheth came today”. Gandhi also started an ‘Antyaj Ratri Shala’ for Dalits at the ashram, besides encouraging the inmates to practise celibacy, do physical labour and wear swadeshi.
In June 1917, when plague hit the city, Gandhi shifted the ashram to Sabarmati, some 8 km away. In Sabarmati, he founded the Harijan Ashram, now popular as the Gandhi ashram.
Although Diwan does not have any historic documents on the exchange between his grandfather and Gandhi, the extended Desai family, spread between Ahmedabad and the US, often gets together at Kochrab for family photographs.
They are also happy to have the permission to “host some family events there some times, while maintaining the sanctity of the place, without band-baja,” says Gita Diwan."
Lok Sabha poll dates in: Why all eyes will be on these 10 regions,"Will BJP's South push pay off, will Hindi heartland show Cong any love, will Nitish-plus BJP mean an NDA Bihar repeat... For both BJP and INDIA, the following states hold key",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/pulse-collage.jpg?w=640,"While Prime Minister Narendra Modi's website describes 'Modi Ki Guarantee', the Congress has so far announced 25 guarantees. (PTI Photos)","WHILE THERE are several issues which are expected to play out in the coming Lok Sabha polls, it may boil down to a fight between ‘Modi Ki Guarantee’ vs Congress’s ‘Nyay’ guarantees.
On Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s website, ‘Modi Ki Guarantee’ is described as a guarantee for the “development of youth”, “empowerment of women”, “welfare of farmers”, and “progress of the marginalised and vulnerable ignored for decades”, via saturation distribution of its welfare schemes.
The Congress has so far announced 25 guarantees, building up on similar promises which, it believes, helped it notch up wins in state polls in Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana. These include 5 ‘Nyay’ guarantees for youth, women and farmers each, and 10 more announced on Saturday. Most of these were unveiled over the course of Rahul Gandhi’s Manipur-to-Mumbai Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra.
Apart from the guarantee vs guarantee narrative, the issues which are likely to come up in the campaign are unemployment and price rise, which the INDIA bloc parties have been consistently raising; abrogation of Article 370, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the start of the process towards a Uniform Civil Code, all of which the Modi government has initiated since its 2019 win; the Ram Mandir consecration, which is fulfillment of one of the BJP’s core promises; electoral bonds data, released in the run-up to the polls and giving a clear indication of how money donations were influenced by power and the use of it; and farmers’ issues, with the recent protest set to make MSP a poll topic.
Against the above issues, these will be the 10 things to watch out for in the polls, region-wise:
Of the 129 Lok Sabha seats spread across five states – Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh — and the Union territory of Puducherry, the BJP currently holds only 29 (25 of these in Karnataka, and 4 in Telangana). The rest are with the Congress and its allies, the Left, BRS, YSRCP and 1 seat each with the AIMIM and JD(S).
In the run-up to the elections, the BJP has focused on the South, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi leading the push. The party realises that it needs to make gains in this region, having saturated its performance in the Hindi belt, if it wants to come close to its target of 370 for the BJP alone, plus 400-plus for the NDA.
Significantly, when the Congress enjoyed similar dominance in Lok Sabha polls in the past, it had as much presence in the South as the North.
The Congress was decimated in the Hindi heartland both in 2014 and 2019, resulting in the party plunging to its all-time low tally of 44 in 2014 and 52 in the last Lok Sabha elections. In 2019, the Congress could win only 1 seat each in Uttar Pradesh (Sonia Gandhi in Rae Bareli), Bihar (Kishanganj) and Madhya Pradesh (Chhindwara), which together account for 149 seats. Besides, the Congress could not open its account in Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, won 2 seats in Chhattisgarh, and 1 in Jharkhand.
This left the party with just 6 seats out of 225, spread across 10 states in central India.
The Congress hopes to do well in the South – on its own in Telangana, Karnataka (where it is in power), and Kerala (which it swept last time), and Tamil Nadu (where it has a strong ally in the DMK). However, this will not be enough if the party wants to make a dent in the coming polls. The most recent Assembly elections, where it suffered setbacks in the Hindi heartland states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, were not promising.
The last two times, the Congress, while the second-largest party, could not win enough seats to get Leader of the Opposition post. It will hope to correct that, with at least 55 constituencies, and more.
The BJP won 71 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP in 2014 (73, counting the NDA), and 62 (64 for the NDA) in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The Samajwadi Party, BSP and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) had stitched up a meaningful alliance in 2019, helping them dent the BJP dominance a bit. This time, the RLD is with the NDA, the SP is aligned with the Congress, which has not made up any lost ground in UP, and the BSP is contesting alone. That apart, the inauguration of the Ram Temple at Ayodhya, plus gains for the Hindu side at the disputed Kashi Vishwanath Temple-Gyanvapi Masjid complex, are expected to boost the BJP.
Can the BJP better 2014, or a stronger SP hold it back? That will be the thing to watch.
With Nitish Kumar-led JD(U)’s re-entry, the NDA is back to its formidable combination in Bihar, which had last time helped it to 39 out of 40 Lok Sabha seats in the state. Along with Chirag Paswan’s LJP (R), this alliance brings together the upper castes, the non-Yadav OBCs, the EBCs and Dalit Dusadhs.
On the other side are the RJD, Congress and Left, with a largely Muslim-Yadav base, plus some EBC influence. However, young RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has been drawing crowds with jobs as an agenda, beyond the party’s largely caste-based politics.
If he makes a dent in the NDA tally in Bihar, it might affect the BJP’s Mission 370.
The BJP has been gaining ground in Bengal, but is still nowhere close to dislodging the ruling Trinamool Congress as the main party. However, in 2019 too, no one expected the BJP to finish with 18 seats, just 4 behind the TMC’s 22.
This time, the BJP is hoping that the Sandeshkhali episode, leaving the TMC red-faced over allegations against its leaders, and its fulfilled promise of easing citizenship for refugees under the CAA will give it the kickoff it needs in Bengal. There are a huge number of refugees in Bengal from Bangladesh who expect to now become valid Indian citizens.
At the same time, the BJP’s opponents are hoping it will face blowback from the CAA in Assam. Here, the entry of immigrants is a sensitive issue, and protests against the CAA have already begun. However, the BJP points out that it won the Assam Assembly polls in 2021 even after the widespread anti-CAA protests of 2019.
In 2019, the BJP won 9 of Assam’s 14 Lok Sabha seats, while the Congress won 3 and the AIUDF 1. The Congress is part of a 15-party grouping, but both this regional alliance and the INDIA bloc have largely failed to come to an understanding in the state.
While the Congress was a force in Punjab till the last Lok Sabha elections, the Aam Aadmi Party dealt it a big blow in the 2022 Assembly polls. The Congress has not been able to get its divided house in order still.
However, what might help the two parties is that the BJP remains a relatively weak party in the state, with just an urban Hindu base. Rural Punjab, particularly Sikhs, have further turned away from the party over farmer issues – over which the Akali Dal also split from it.
In 2019, the Congress won 8 of the 13 Lok Sabha seats in Punjab, the Akali Dal and BJP 2 each, and the AAP 1. Can the Congress retain this hold, which will be crucial to its tally, or will the AAP make gains? June 4 will tell.
Maharashtra has been in an endless churn over the last few years, with both its big regional players — Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party — undergoing vertical splits. The “recognised” factions of both are now with the BJP and in power. However, the more “recognised” leaders of the two parties – be it Uddhav Thackeray or Sharad Pawar – are part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition, including the Congress.
Will the parties matter, or the leaders, could well decide how Maharashtra goes this time, with all bets out as the talks on both sides drag out.
In 2019, the BJP and undivided Shiv Sena in alliance won 41 of the 48 seats (BJP 23 and Sena 18), while the Congress-NCP alliance was reduced to just 5, with the Congress winning just 1 seat.
Haryana has also seen quite some churn in recent months, with the Jat unease with the ruling BJP seeing its latest reflection in the exit of sitting MP Brijendra Singh to the Congress. The BJP has tried to recalibrate its calculations with a government reshuffle, making an OBC the CM, and cutting off ties with Dushyant Chautala’s Jannayak Janata Party, whose Jat base might incidentally stay on now with him.
The BJP won all the 10 Lok Sabha seats in the state in 2019. However, the Congress is seen as having clawed its way back to some extent, playing on Jat and farmer anger, and the BJP might find it difficult to repeat its 2019 sweep.
The BJP has tied up with Chandrababu Naidu’s Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the JanaSena Party of Pawan Kalyan, and will contest 6 Lok Sabha seats in a state where it drew a blank in 2019. It has thus bet on anti-incumbency against the YSRCP government of Jagan Mohan Reddy, with the Assembly polls being held simultaneously in the state with the Lok Sabha elections.
The Congress made a strong comeback in the Assembly elections held in 2023 to return to power in the state, winning 135 of 224 seats. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP won 25 seats out of 28 while the Congress won just 1. But apart from being in power in the state, the Congress has two regional heavyweights in Siddaramaiah and D K Shivakumar, who are capable of thwarting any BJP challenge.
The BJP is counting on the popularity of PM Modi, as well as the machinations of old warhorse and influential Lingayat leader B S Yediyurappa. The tie-up with the JD(S) may also help it get the Vokkaligas on board."
Bureaucrat Amarjeet Sinha’s expert take on policy’s last-mile challenges,"Sinha raises a fundamental question of public policy: should Amrit Kaal India grow by a GDP number, the “5 trillion dollar economy”, or by the well-being of her people by investing in education, health, skills and basic amenities?",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/The-Last-Mile-Featured.jpg?w=640,"Amarjeet Sinha raises a fundamental question of public policy: should Amrit Kaal India grow by a GDP number, the “5 trillion dollar economy”, or by the well-being of her people by investing in education, health, skills, basic amenities, and transparent governance? (Source: Amazon.in)","While India has come a long way since 1947, there are miles to go to secure a life of well-being for all, an opportunity for every Indian to develop their fullest human potential through access to good health, education and skills…” The Last Mile has been written by Amarjeet Sinha, a civil servant who has played an important role formulating important social sector programmes like Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and National Rural Health Mission. It makes extensive use of data, reports and studies, and draws on the author’s 35-plus years of experience that includes visiting more than 95 percent of India’s districts.
Sinha raises a fundamental question of public policy: should Amrit Kaal India grow by a GDP number, the “5 trillion dollar economy”, or by the well-being of her people by investing in education, health, skills, basic amenities, and transparent governance? He makes a clear choice for the latter. He also lays great emphasis on diversifying the livelihoods base of 24 crore poor people and strengthening their assets base to move them out of perennial poverty. He suggests improving governance not only for “ease of growing” but “ease of living”.
A related issue is public versus private provision of education, health, water, and sanitation.  This has become more pertinent in the liberalisation era, with policy shifting towards privatising social services. Sinha, though, makes a strong case for public policy to “ensure that the fruits of quality reach every school and hospital, whether private or public”. He argues that “we need to get out of the binary of public and private and move towards creating community institutions”. He evokes the principle of decentralization and pleads for effective devolution of power to the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) and the Urban Local Bodies.
The book’s central argument — people-centric development — is exemplified in the chapter on a “poverty-free India”. It demonstrates the progress in massive poverty reduction, especially since 2004-05, and points to the daunting challenge of moving the remaining 24 crore people out of poverty. Sinha envisages a clear role for the Indian state, as the market may not be interested in investing in poor people: to harness the resources of women collectives and self-help groups (SHGs) which have already grown hugely in size; community institutions and resources; PRIs and civil society organizations; and Corporate Social Responsibility programmes.
Two chapters analyse how women collectives and SHGs under the National Rural Livelihood Mission have changed the face of rural poverty across Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, Gujarat and Assam. About 100 million women are organised into 8 million SHGs which are carrying out vibrant economic activities. An example is in the flow of bank credit to women’s SHGs having grown to Rs 6.5 lakh crore between 2014 and 2022, at a 30 percent annual credit growth rate. The non-performing assets of bank loans to SHGs have come down significantly from 7.1 percent in 2012-13 to 2 percent in 2021-22 — much lower than that of the corporate sector. Yet, banks favour big corporates over micro-enterprises and so does industrial policy.


Women’s SHGs have harnessed bank credit to run 24,520 custom hiring centres, rent out agricultural implements and pump sets, provide 2165 transport services in remote and Naxal-affected areas, and run bio-fertilizer units, shops, horticulture, animal husbandry. They have also tapped e-platforms to market products. About 600 SHG products are available on Amazon and Flipkart and about 1080 products on the government e-market. The flow of bank credit to women’s SHGs is no longer confined to Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka (which used to corner 85 per cent of the total bank credit to SHGs in 2013-14). It has grown significantly in Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam — the states with higher rural poverty.
Chapters on education, health, and skills show how clear policy goals make a real difference. For example, in 1986, the year of the National Policy on Education (NEP), 69.2 percent of rural females aged six-plus were never enrolled in a school, and all the SC girls in Bihar and ST girls in Andhra Pradesh dropped out of schools. NEP and SSA made a difference. Now there’s almost complete enrolment of boys and girls at the primary level. The drop-out rate has come down dramatically, almost negligible at the lower primary level. Though there are challenges in ensuring a 100 percent transition from lower to upper primary, upper primary to secondary, and from secondary to higher secondary levels.
This book greatly emphasised the period since 2014-15, though 2004-05 may be considered a real departure in New Welfarism in India. A series of important legislations, like the right to work (MGNREGA, 2005), the Right to Forest Act (2006), Right to Education Act (2009), Right to Food (NFSA, 2013), and right to rehabilitations (land compensation Act, 2013) were enacted to provide rights-based development opportunities. An analysis of this New Welfarism is the only missing point of discussion, in an otherwise comprehensive and meaningful book."
UPSC Ethics Simplified | Conscience and Ethical Decision making: The Caselet,How does police officer act as a 'conscience keeper' in a situation of crisis? Nanditesh Nilay narrates a case and provides some Post-Read Questions for your Ethics paper for UPSC CSE.,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/WhatsApp-Image-2024-03-17-at-14.31.26.jpeg?w=640,"""We have to act as a conscience keeper in the middle of a crisis. And we have to be a person of perseverance too.""","UPSC Ethics Simplified draws your attention to a topic of greed and desire in the form of a caselet. This caselet is an extension of the concept discussed on March 3 (Conscience and Ethical Decision Making: The Concept). It is advised to revisit the concept article before reading the caselet below.
Relevance: The topic is a part of UPSC CSE General Studies Paper-IV Ethics syllabus. Concepts are particularly relevant in the theory section. Aspirants will also find the article useful for their Essay paper and situation-based questions in personality tests. Moreover, the essence of the article will help aspirants in their professional lives or in life in general.
Nanditesh Nilay writes for UPSC Ethics Simplified fortnightly on Sundays. The first article will be a concept while the second article will be a caselet based on the concept.
He was surrounded by a mob that day, and even as a policeman, he had never dealt with such a violent situation. He was new to force. A large group of people were looking frenzy for a man from a different community. They were shouting violently and things were going out of control. The name of the police officer was Sahas Singh.
That day, sun’s rays were vertical  and he was profusely sweating. He was able to hold the person despite his sweating palm.
“Don’t worry. I am here to save you. Please don’t think anything negative,” Sahas said. But the man was trembling. “They will kill me, sir. My fault is that I am from a different community,” the man cried.
“See my face too. I am also not from your community. And this is not my duty hour. I am on leave. Still, I didn’t find any crisis of conscience within because I am always close to my conscience. It is guiding me to save your life. You are a human being for me. Nothing more, nothing less,” Sahas Singh shouted. Meanwhile, they were being pushed and abused by the mob.
Sahas was remembering the words of his teacher on the last day of school, “Sahas, lead your life with the voice of conscience. You have to act as a conscience keeper. Don’t let the environment arrest your purpose of living. Conscience is everything, Sahas, and in a world where mankind is hit badly by class, caste, religion, work pressure, greed, selfishness, arrogance, ego, and fear, you have to listen to that pure voice of duty and humanity. That can only be done if you are well prepared to face the blowing wind of a crisis that wants to blow your conscience.”
Sahas was standing tall. He replied, “I will never let you down, sir. Wherever I am, my actions and my conduct will be like those of a trustee of conscience. I am and I will be your conscience keeper, sir.”
At this moment, Sahas tightly held the boy’s hand and yelled, “You can not do any harm to him till the time I am here with him. For all of you, he is not a human but a lesser mortal, and that is because you all are also not above your community. Is your God different from my God or his God? Listen to your conscience.”
With this, Sahas began running with that person towards an incoming police van, and finally succeeded in saving the person’s life.
1. You have to act as a conscience keeper. What does this mean with reference to the caselet?
2. Evaluate the role of Sahas from ethical and professional perspectives.
3. What is the importance of the voice of conscience in your life? Had you been in the above situation, what values would have been on test along with the crisis of conscience? 
We have to act as a conscience keeper in the middle of a crisis, and we have to be a person of perseverance too. Perseverance is continued persistence in doing what one considers to be right despite difficulties or delays in achieving the desired results. It implies unwavering steadfastness in pursuing the right course of action, even in the face of odds/obstacles/pressures or failures. In dealing with public affairs such situations are not uncommon and therefore perseverance is a valuable attribute to be successful in the long run.

"As his second Yatra ends, Rahul Gandhi clearly has come a distance – but what about his party?","He has emerged as a symbol for those opposed to Modi, especially minorities, attracted crowds and earned political gravitas. But for INDIA, and even Congress, Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra was a missed opportunity.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/pm-modi-patnaik-8.jpg?w=640,"Through his two Yatras, over the last two years, first from South to North and more recently from East to West, Rahul has gained a national profile. (Express Photo by Vishal Srivastav)","Paradoxically, Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra ended the same day as the Election Commission announced the Lok Sabha polls for 2024, though the Yatra’s final rally is to take place in Mumbai on Sunday at the historic Shivaji Park.
It will now get converted into the first election meeting by the Opposition INDIA bloc in Maharashtra, which has acquired an importance all its own for both sides.
Through his two Yatras, over the last two years, first from South to North and more recently from East to West, Rahul has gained a national profile. Position or no position, he is today recognised as THE leader of the Congress who is taking decisions for the party, no matter who is in-charge officially.
He has also become a symbol for all those dissatisfied with the Narendra Modi rule. And the first choice of the minorities —wherever the Congress is in a position to get its act together.
Last Friday, at the Muslim-dominated powerloom city of Bhiwandi in Thane district, a crowd of 7,000-10,000 of mainly Muslims waited for him to arrive from Palghar for the last lap of his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, even though it was time to break their Ramzan roza. Speaker after speaker from the community urged those present to work to make Rahul the prime minister. As they milled round the Anant Dighe Chowk, they nostalgically recalled the Congress rule and the “mohabbat (harmony)” of earlier years!
The curiosity about Rahul has also increased in the last two years; people want to know more about him. At Bhiwandi, I found a large group of Hindu women who had come with their children. “We wanted to see for ourselves what he is like”, “We had heard about him”. Would they be voting for him? “We will vote for whoever works for us.”
Rahul has also emerged as the sharpest critic of Modi today. He did not mince his words two days ago while criticising the PM, calling the now-scrapped electoral bonds scheme the biggest “extortion” undertaken at the behest of Modi.
Over the last two years, Rahul has become more confident in the way he handles questions from the media; on electoral bonds, he remained determinedly focused on his subject, not letting the media deflect him by raising issues around the Congress’s culpability in other matters. (Still, he continues to berate the media at every opportunity he gets!)
Congress workers also noted that between the two Yatras, Rahul did not disappear abroad as frequently as he used to earlier.
By design or default, in the way the situation has developed, and without being officially projected as the alternative to Modi either by his own party or by the Opposition alliance, it is Rahul who is seen as the counter to Modi in the battle that now lies ahead for the Delhi gaddi.
Rahul Gandhi’s Yatra-1 was a novel, innovative idea. People responded positively to a politician, and that too the “Prince-like” scion of the Nehru Gandhi family, walking 4,000 km to come to them and listen to them. He stayed the course and the whole exercise helped him shed his non-serious, so-called “Pappu” image.
Though Rahul continued with the faux pas he is known for, such as a negative reference to V D Savarkar in Maharashtra, a state where he is a respected figure, during his first Yatra. This time, there was much heartburn within the Congress over his contemptuous reference to those who attended the Ayodhya Ram Temple consecration, saying it only had “people like Ambani, Adani” or a “dancing” Aishwarya Rai.
The second Yatra, particularly its timing, was also mystifying. Elections were around the corner, seat-sharing had to be finetuned with coalition partners; new challenges faced the INDIA bloc, with Mamata Banerjee pulling out, as did the Jayant Choudhary-led RLD. And a Yatra on wheels was like so many other such endeavours, with politicians undertaking tours all the time, interspersed with small group meetings.
Still, as during his first Yatra, Rahul drew large crowds in some places, such as in Nashik earlier this week where, as per a Congress leader, “Bhayankar response tha (There was huge response)”. The Communists have had a base in the region, and ally Shiv Sena also put its best foot forward.
But, at the end of the day, the Yatras have done little to rebuild a dying Congress organisation. There could have been follow-up camps across the country, along the routes Rahul followed, tapping into the enthusiasm and new energies generated by his Yatra to create a support base for his party. Even when people talk of the good response Rahul drew in some places, they express in the next breath what worries most Congress karyakartas, “But we don’t know if this will convert into votes!”
An organisation is a necessary prerequisite for garnering votes. And ultimately, a political party is all about power and winning elections – before it can get on to “serving the people”, or “changing policy” or “protecting democracy”.
It was towards the end of his Yatra-2, particularly after he entered Maharashtra, a state which is going to decide fortunes in the coming elections, that Rahul struck a poll pitch, and announced ‘Nyay’ / guarantees for farmers, youth and women like agenda points for his party’s manifesto. He also shared the stage with NCP (SP) supremo Sharad Pawar and Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut in Nashik, giving it the flavour of the INDIA bloc fighting the polls together.
Rahul’s Yatra-2, many feel, could have been more of the above – about the INDIA alliance, and less about himself, signalling, as nothing else could have done, the coalition getting ready for the 2024 polls, moving in step from state to state. But the allies were not consulted, and they were made part of the journey only at the last moment, as in UP and later in Maharashtra. It was an opportunity lost.
“India is at a point today, not unlike the situation it faced in 1947”, said an entrepreneur in Pune, “to be or not to be inclusive.” Rahul raised the right issues, the entrepreneur added, “par woh unki pakad mein nahin aa rahe hain (but he is not able to convey the same to connect with the people)”.
This was also true of issues such as “berozgari (unemployment)” – a reality for so many. Selling cucumbers from a cart at a chowk in Thane, Vikas Kumar said he had come all the way to Mumbai from Poorvi Champaran in search of work. “I have to pay Rs 4,000 per month to the policeman, eke out a living and send money to my ailing mother back home,” says the 20-year-old OBC youth.
Rahul’s posters around him, Vikas says he has heard about the Yatra. But the ideas espoused by Rahul, including caste census, language that suggests the Congress leader sees himself in the role of Mandal Messiah-2 – his constant refrain that “90% of India (OBCs, SCs, STs, minorities) does not figure among the top positions in the country’s bureaucracy, judiciary, or the media” – do not resonate with Vikas.
But now the die has been cast. Rahul’s opponent is no ordinary foe – pitching as Modi is for 370 seats this time. There will now be no time for anything but hard bargaining across the table for seats, and the heat and dust of a long, gruelling campaign spread over seven phases.
It is once again over to the people of India.

(Representational Image),"One of the things I do not like being called is a ‘veteran journalist’. It makes me feel ancient. But I have no hesitation in admitting that I have been around in journalism for a very long time and that this has its advantages. It has enabled me to bear witness to a lot of history and a lot of elections and it has made me learn how to view political events and changes from a vantage point of some distance. This could be why I see the electoral bonds scheme with a degree of perspective. Do not get me wrong. I have no intention of defending this dangerously deceptive scheme. I am very happy that the Supreme Court demanded answers and forced the names of donors to political parties to be revealed along with their donations.
This scheme that turned ‘black’ money snowy white as soon as it became a political donation was ‘not perfect’ as the finance minister admitted at the India Today conclave last week. But she was right when she reminded the audience that the system that existed before was much worse. It might have been more accurate to say that it did nothing to improve corrupt practices from times of yore.
I remember elections in the seventies and eighties, and even in more recent times, when powerful politicians were able to coerce industrialists to make huge donations with the promise that if they won, they would ensure payback. Stashes of cash continue to be found regularly in the homes of politicians and their associates which means the practice is thriving. Money is concealed this way because it is usually dirty money. The election bonds were supposedly an attempt to make political donations more transparent, but this did not happen. The bonds failed to bring transparency or end black money which is what they were created to do. But they provided a useful cover for political parties who wanted to appear to have hands too clean to touch black money.
Congress Party spokesmen are taking a high moral tone on the issue and tarring the BJP. Hypocrites. Have they forgotten their own grubby history? In the seventies and eighties when elections came, Delhi’s political grapevine would buzz with rumours of ‘suitcases of cash’ coming from the Soviet Union. Nobody ever confirmed if this was true or not but many years later, when KGB spymaster Vasili Mitrokhin wrote his memoirs, he mentioned casually that several members of Indira Gandhi’s cabinet were on the KGB payroll. Mitrokhin’s revelations were damning and should have caused a furor in India. This did not happen because nobody seemed really surprised.
Anyone with the smallest interest in the Indian political system knows well that our elections are funded by money donated by rich businessmen and that often these donations are linked to a contract or a favour. What is worrying about the donations made through the election bonds is that some of them seem to have been made to evade environmental clearances. Others seem to have been made by people who feared that they were on the verge of being raided by the Enforcement Directorate or the Income Tax department.
It is not easy to break the symbiotic relationship that exists all over the world between big money and big politics but in countries that have better checks and balances things work better. If India’s political system continues to be reliant on black money it is mostly the fault of our political leaders. If they made it easier for businessmen to work without needing to rely on bribery and corruption there would be less black money. The question we need to be asking is why this has not already happened, and the answer could be that it suits our politicians to fund their elections with hidden resources.
The electoral bonds were an attempt to conceal this ugly truth rather than an honest attempt to bring transparency into the political system and this is why the Supreme Court has expressed its disapproval so strongly. So, will things change some day soon? The sad truth is that this is unlikely because what happens at the very top of our political system also happens at the very bottom. In rural India people talk openly about how their local leaders never let go of their position until they can give it to a relative because politics has become such a lucrative business. When they contest elections, they do it on other people’s money and not their own. This they use to build themselves big houses and buy their family big cars.
The Supreme Court’s resolve to lift the veils that concealed the names of the people who bought those election bonds and the names of the parties who benefited from them is a vital first step towards change. But, for real change to happen there will need to be a total cleansing of our political culture. When Narendra Modi first became prime minister one of his first ‘guarantees’ was that he would end black money. If he becomes prime minister for the third term, we must hope that he will deliver on this promise because there is no question that things need to change if India is to ever become a developed country.
Countries whose elections are fueled by black money usually remain trapped in the swamp and miasma that corrupt political systems wallow in forever."
"Three years since inception, here’s how Delhi’s Specialised Schools of Excellence are faring","In Aam Aadmi Party-ruled Punjab too, where the party had pitched the ‘Delhi model’ of education during the 2022 Assembly polls in the state, similar specialised schools, called ‘Schools of Eminence’, are being set up.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/delhi-schools.jpg?w=640,Students attend Robotics course at the School of Special Learning (SOSE) Rohini in New Delhi on Friday. (Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal),"Is this a board exam, wondered an autorickshaw driver, as anxious parents, some with school bags slung over their shoulders, and children, crowded around the gate of Delhi government’s School of Specialised Excellence (SoSE) in Kalkaji one morning in the middle of February.
The school’s security guard allowed students in one by one for what was not a board exam, but a group discussion — which forms the second round of testing for admission to the humanities course for classes 9 and 11 at Delhi’s SoSEs.
Sitting in a classroom with four other students for the discussion that day, on “whether social media is destroying creativity”, Doli, who was applying to Class 9, spoke about the problem of cyberbullying and loneliness from excessive social media use. She was studying at a private school in Sangam Vihar that offered classes only till Grade 8. “… With the financial position at home, one of my teachers said I could apply to one of these government schools that are good,” said Doli, whose father is a driver and mother a housewife. She intends to take the UPSC exam eventually.
Also part of the discussion was Darshana Sakla; her take was that social media could be useful, entertaining, and “increase the capability to think”. She too was in a private school in Tigri Extension that offered classes only till Grade 8. “The first admission round, a test, went well…,” said Darshana, whose father is associated with scrap recycling.
The two girls are among 1,44,200 applicants seeking admission to the 38 SoSEs — the government’s showpiece schools, rich in facilities and with small class sizes — for the upcoming academic year. This is 24 times the number of seats — around 6,000 — likely to be up for grabs in these schools. There are five streams on offer, from STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and Humanities to ‘High-End 21st Century Skills’ (HE-21) which teaches robotics, graphic design and coding. There is also a specific stream to prepare one to get into the NDA, taught at the Armed Forces Preparatory School. The fifth is Performing and Visual Arts.
In Aam Aadmi Party-ruled Punjab too, where the party had pitched the ‘Delhi model’ of education during the 2022 Assembly polls in the state, similar specialised schools, called ‘Schools of Eminence’, are being set up.
The Indian Express visited two schools in Delhi, at Kalkaji and Rohini, and spoke to students and teachers to understand how they are faring.
What’s on offer
Since they were set up three years ago in 2021-22, the number of students applying to SoSEs has increased. This year for Class 9, STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) has received the most applications — at 37,960 — while Humanities is the second most popular. In Class 11, the highest number of applications this time was for STEM — 28,135. (see box).
The application influx for STEM in Class 11 could have to do with the assistance provided for crucial entrance exams like NEET and JEE: SoSEs offering this stream have Vidyamandir Classes as a knowledge partner, while sessions and time-bound papers are offered for competitive exam preparation.
Class 11 student Aashray Kumar, who moved to the Kalkaji SoSE — which offers STEM and humanities — from a private school, said, “I enjoy math and science. The fees in my old school were high… I learnt about the SoSE during the pandemic. Here, coaching and school go together…” Kumar lives in Govindpuri and hopes to pursue a BTech programme. His father is a home tutor.
Ayushi, also a Class 11 student who moved to the SoSE from another government school, said: “This school is better… there are more and better labs. There are workshops too; we had one recently on intellectual property rights.” Her father is an auto driver.

For some students, it isn’t just about the infrastructure, but also the specialisations themselves.
Khushi Chaudhry, a Class 11 student at the SoSE in Rohini Sector 11, which offers the HE-21 stream, moved here from a private one with this particular specialisation in mind. “During Covid, we would have online classes and take exams. It was like being trapped. Then I came across branding and graphic designing and heard about SoSEs. Science would have been a safer option, but HE-21 struck me as something different. It was difficult to adapt in the beginning… but I was able to explore graphic design… the course teaches you how to use design tools,” she said.
Chaudhry is learning digital media design, one of six specialised courses offered in the stream. The others are robotics, coding, fashion, finance and accounting, and electromechanical production. While students get to try all six in classes 9 and 10, they choose one for classes 11 and 12.

Of the 82 students in Class 11 in the school, 20 chose coding, while 10 picked robotics. The finance and accounting course, which includes aspects of investing, was the most popular, with 27 students.
The Rohini school also offers several facilities: Chromebooks, iPads, and Mac desktops for students and smart classrooms.
At the school’s digital media design lab in February, students were working on their Chromebooks and iPads on branding for tourist spots in Delhi — figuring out how to design brochures and an app for locations like Safdarjung Tomb. They were learning with a special resource person from IIT-Delhi, which is a ‘knowledge partner’ with the HE-21 SoSEs, along with NIFT Delhi which provides a resource person for the fashion specialisation. The ‘knowledge partners’ provide support with curriculum design and resource persons.
The school also has six labs; the robotics and electromechanical production ones in particular are equipped with sensors, micro-controllers, electrical circuits, and equipment for soldering and welding.
For Md Shaan Serwal, a Class 11 student who picked robotics, the lab is of great help since equipment is difficult to come by elsewhere. “I might still be able to figure out coding online. (But for robotics)… we get components and hardware (in school)… I will need both robotics and coding for game development, which I want to do later,” said Serwal, who moved to the SoSE from a government school.
Aman Khushwaha, a class 9 student working with a group to put a small car together in one of the labs, said he wanted to join a Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya after his sister had done well at one such school, but admissions had stopped. He picked the SoSE instead, hoping to study coding and robotics.
The new system, meanwhile, saw its share of apprehensions.
Class 11 student Harshita Gupta, specialising in digital media design at the Rohini SoSE, moved from a private school. “What fascinated me was the specialised subjects. I didn’t want to do humanities or science… Some of my relatives said this whole system was an experiment and we were going to be guinea pigs… my mother too didn’t want me to join here since the idea is that private schools are better. But we decided to apply anyway,” said the 16-year-old, whose father is a tuition teacher.
Said school principal Vipin Kumar, “This is all new… HE-21 was new to us too when it was introduced in 2021. Even parents are becoming more aware, slowly.”
He added that of the 288 students in his school — 178 boys and 110 girls — around 40% are likely to be from private schools.
Incidentally, only a small fraction of students in Delhi have access to such sought-after facilities — 8,107 students were enrolled in SoSEs in 2023-24, when the total number of students in 1,039 Delhi government schools was 17.85 lakh in 2022-23.
Flexible curriculum
SoSEs are affiliated with the Delhi Board of School Education (DBSE), introduced in 2021 with a focus on “understanding and learning rather than scoring marks by rote learning”. It has partnered with the International Baccalaureate (IB), a private international education board, to implement its programmes, including assessment and teaching methods.
“The idea is to offer skill-based education. Not everybody might want to pursue higher education after Class 12… DBSE provides for a continuous assessment system. This can make sure exam fever is limited,” Principal Kumar said.
The curriculum can also be flexible, he added: “Teachers participate in deciding course content and there are co-creation workshops. DBSE has a curriculum team, and knowledge partners are also involved. Before each unit, teachers can decide on additions and rectifications in the unit. So, the curriculum may change as per need.”
While it offers more options to students, DBSE has been different for teachers as well, said Vineeta Mathur, PGT (postgraduate teacher) computer science, who teaches coding at the Rohini school.
Preeti Sharma, who teaches English, said, “The curriculum is different, and we need to prepare for it. Students, for example, are learning to hold interviews; the curriculum is based on application more than just theory.”
Foundational subjects like English and Mathematics are taught at the SoSEs, depending on the stream.
According to Suman Taneja, Principal at the Kalkaji SoSE, which has 528 students, with a maximum of 30 in one section, the assessment is not percentage-based: “In classes 9 and 10, there are descriptors and grade points… Pen-and-paper tests happen at the end of the term. After each unit plan, there is a unit end assessment.” She added: “Parents are usually confused that there is no percentage, no ranking. We have an orientation for them in Class 9.”
On study material, Taneja explained that unit plans are prepared for teachers and student companions — workbooks and notebooks — and shared with students. “These are prepared in consultation with teachers from different schools… NCERT textbooks and other resources like those for NEET and JEE and refresher books for science and social studies are used for reference. Teachers also refer to MYP (Middle Years Programme of IB) resources for the foundational courses. For the advanced courses, knowledge partners have their material that is shared with students,” she said.
Explaining how teachers are hired, she said that apart from the resource persons engaged by the knowledge partners, teachers in SoSEs are government school teachers already in the system. “An announcement is made through a circular asking teachers who wish to join SoSEs to come forward for an interface. A panel is created for each subject to interact with these teachers to know how well they can adapt to the new pedagogy. If they are found suitable, they are transferred to the SoSE. Once they join, they go through co-creation and orientation sessions like other teachers, which happens every two months,” Taneja added."
"In Lok Sabha polls 2024, Congress hopes for a repeat of 2004, stares at heartland challenge","Congress party has been struggling to build a narrative that BJP can be defeated and that INDIA bloc can be its credible alternative, with the latter yet to come up with a common roadmap.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/pm-modi-patnaik-3.jpg?w=640,The Congress hopes Rahul’s Yatras -- the second one centered around the theme of “Nyay” -- have struck a chord with the people. (Express file photo by Amit Mehra),"Rahul Gandhi has walked the extra mile, while his party Congress has swallowed pride and joined a band of disparate Opposition parties to stop the Narendra Modi juggernaut and announced, perhaps for the first time, a raft of poll promises even before the election schedule was announced.
Despite these unprecedented political moves, the Congress is entering the Lok Sabha battlefield with just a flicker of hope of a repeat of the 2004 verdict.
Its grand plan to ensure that there is one Opposition candidate against the BJP in 400 plus Lok Sabha seats has not fully materialised — there will still be Opposition coalitions in several states — and the INDIA alliance has struggled to sustain its momentum after its much-hyped launch in Patna last year largely because of internal divisions and bickerings besides some high-profile exits.
The Congress is also entering the Lok Sabha campaign perhaps with a sense of deja vu.
In 2019, its campaign had two broad themes — the “chowkidar chor hai” line of attack against Prime Minister Modi over the Rafale fighter jet deal, and the ambitious promise of a minimum income guarantee to the poor, or NYAY as it was called. And now, with the party having revived NYAY, revelations about the nature of anonymous contributions to political parties through electoral bonds will form the dual core of its attack.
The grand old party has added one more layer — a relentless pitch for a caste census and the talk of representation for the OBCs, Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST). The Congress hopes that its OBC, tribal and Dalit gambit will have a resonance, and its welfare promises would strike a chord. The party believes there is “silent anger” brewing against the BJP government among the youth over lack of jobs and among the lower middle class and poor families because of the rise in the cost of living.
But the main Opposition party appears has been struggling to build a political discourse and narrative that the BJP can be defeated and that the INDIA bloc can be its credible alternative. The faltering alliance is yet to come up with a common programme, or articulate a clear governance agenda. Not even once have the alliance partners managed to bring all its top leaders together on one single public platform. The best case scenario, for many in the Congress, is a repeat of a 2004-like verdict, when the BJP’s “India Shining” campaign had come a cropper.
With Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) and Jayant Chaudhary’s RLD walking out of the INDIA bloc and Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress (TMC) all but snapping ties with it, the alliance no longer looks formidable and perhaps lacks a national appeal. The Samajwadi Party (SP)-Congress alliance in Uttar Pradesh and the AAP-Congress seat sharing arrangement in Delhi have come as just cold comfort to it. There will, of course, be seat sharing pacts in Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Maharashtra and Jharkhand — those alliances pre-date the formation of the INDIA bloc.
The Congress hopes Rahul’s Yatras — the second one centered around the theme of “Nyay” — have struck a chord with the people. The promises it has announced so far are tailored for and focused on the unemployed youth, women, tribals, Dalits, the working class and the farmers, and dovetail into the larger theme of justice — social, economic and political.
North India, however, remains the Achilles heel for the Congress. The party believes it would perform well in Kerala and Telangana, manage to halve the BJP’s tally in Karnataka and sweep Tamil Nadu along with the senior partner DMK.
The Congress was decimated in the Hindi heartland both in 2014 and 2019, resulting in the party plunging to its all time low tally of 44 in 2014 and 52 in the last Lok Sabha elections.
In 2019, the Congress could win only one each in Uttar Pradesh (Sonia Gandhi in Rae Bareli), Bihar (Kishanganj) and Madhya Pradesh (Chhindwara), which account for 149 seats. It could not open its account in Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. It won two seats in Chhattisgarh and one in Jharkhand. So the party had won just 6 of the 225 Lok Sabha seats spread across 10 states in the heartland.
While the Pulwama attack and the Balakot strike had derailed the Congress momentum in 2019, the party this time is facing a Hindutva-nationalism cocktail in the form of the Ram temple consecration, abrogation of Article 370 and talk around CAA.
The big question is whether the Congress would be able to make a comeback in the Hindi speaking states, where the BJP hopes the consecration of the Ram Temple at Ayodhya will have a huge appeal. Added to that would be the BJP’s poll pitch around the CAA, Sanatan Dharma and the UCC. The Congress or the INDIA bloc have no counter-narrative to the BJP on these issues — the only argument made by Rahul had been about the star-studded guest list at the Temple opening and the lack of commoners there.
The Congress now has spent its longest time out of power — surpassing its eight-year stint in political wilderness from 1996 to 2004. The party has its formidable task cut out to tide over its existential crisis and touch the three-digit mark in the upcoming polls.
In a break from past, the Congress has this time named 82 candidates even before the announcement of the poll dates. Also, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) is meeting on March 19 to approve its poll manifesto."
Why it is necessary to diversify the farming basket,"If farmers’ incomes are to be augmented substantially, Punjab and Haryana have plenty of lessons to learn from states that have already moved into high-value agriculture",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Diversify-the-basket_Premium-01.jpg?w=640,"Punjab, caught up in a rice-wheat system induced by the MSP regime and open-ended procurement, along with free power and highly subsidised fertilisers, failed to diversify to high-value agriculture. (Illustration by CR Sasikumar)","Let us start with a simple question: Which state do you think is most productive in terms of value creation in agriculture on a per hectare (ha) basis? If Punjab comes to mind, you are very off the mark. Punjab, known for its high physical productivity of rice and wheat, falls at number 13 amongst Indian states when it comes to agri-value created — agri-GDP on a per ha basis. There could be at least two ways to estimate it. First, divide state agri-GDP by Net Sown Area (NSA); and second, divide agri-GDP by Gross Cropped Area (GCA), which encompasses the effect of cropping intensity. Here we use both indicators for the year 2021-22, for which the latest information is available.
When we look at agri-GDP/ha through the NSA, Andhra Pradesh (AP) leads the pack with Rs 6.43 lakh/ha, followed closely by West Bengal (WB) with Rs 5.19 lakh/ha, Tamil Nadu (TN) with Rs 5.14 lakh/ha, and so on. Punjab ranks 13th with Rs 3.71 lakh/ha, with Jharkhand trailing at Rs 4.41 lakh/ha. And if that wasn’t enough of a reality check, the disparity becomes starker when we consider agri-GDP/ha of GCA. In this regard, Bihar with Rs 2.18 lakh/ha, Odisha with Rs 2.57/ha, and Assam with Rs 2.34/ha outpace Punjab with Rs 1.92 lakh/ha (see infographic).
What sets these states ahead of Punjab in terms of value added in agriculture is that they have chosen a diversified production basket geared towards high-value products, largely staying away from heavy reliance on the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system.
Punjab, caught up in a rice-wheat system induced by the MSP regime and open-ended procurement, along with free power and highly subsidised fertilisers, failed to diversify to high-value agriculture. This is despite repeated reminders by the Johl Committee report in 1986, and again in 2002. Today, 84 per cent of Punjab’s GCA is under wheat and rice, leading to 76 per cent of its blocks being over-exploited in terms of groundwater.
It is late, but never too late, to switch gears. Punjab and Haryana desperately need a new deal to move away from rice cultivation. Just to save Punjab and Haryana from ecological disaster, a minimum of 1.5 million hectares (Mha) of rice area (out of about 4.5 Mha) needs to be shifted to pulses, oilseeds, and even maize for poultry and ethanol, and fruits and vegetables. For this to happen, crop-neutral incentive structures need to be created. What this means is that the growers of these alternative crops must be rewarded by about Rs 25,000/ha when they switch from paddy to these crops, as that is the minimum savings from power and fertiliser subsidies. This package towards sustainable cropping patterns needs to be devised by the Centre and states together on a 50:50 basis.
But if farmers’ incomes have to be augmented substantially, Punjab and Haryana have plenty of lessons to learn from states that have already diversified into high-value agriculture. In this context, it is interesting to note that the Andhra farmer creates 74 per cent more value in agriculture than his Punjabi counterpart on per ha of NSA. How did that happen?
The answer lies in high-value inland fisheries. With 24 per cent of its agriculture value added (AGVA) attributed to fisheries, AP leads the nation in fish production, contributing 30 per cent to its national output. It is this proficiency in cultivating high-value shrimp that boosts their profitability. This success story of AP serves as a compelling example for Punjab and Haryana if they want to switch from rice-wheat rotation.
Tamil Nadu sets a high bar for fruit cultivation, with mangoes and bananas comprising over 80 per cent of its fruit production in 2020-21. This success translates into a 39 per cent higher value creation in agriculture compared to their counterparts in Punjab. It is a clear signpost for Punjabi farmers’ higher income aspirations. But it is not just about diversifying into horticulture; it is also about embracing innovative agricultural practices.
For example, TN farmers practise Ultra High-Density Plantation (UHDP) for mangoes. This method allows 674 mango trees per acre compared to the traditional method of 40 only. This translates to a significant increase in yield and profits. This technique, being promoted by Jain Irrigation, leads to significant water savings (up to 50 per cent) and fertiliser savings (up to 30 per cent), further enhancing profitability.
West Bengal, a state with only 2 per cent agriculture power consumption in 2021-22, creates 40 per cent more value than Punjab, which gets free power for agriculture. WB cultivates vegetables on 15 per cent (1.5 Mha) of its GCA of 10.2 Mha. The central government’s recognition of this success is evident in the establishment of an Agri-Export Zone (AEZ) dedicated to vegetables in WB, encompassing three key districts: Nadia, Murshidabad, and North 24 Parganas. Year-round production of a variety of vegetables makes cropping intensity so high (199 per cent) in WB. The state has successfully transitioned from a “production-oriented” model to a more strategic “market-driven” system.
This focus on market demands is reflected in their impressive production figures for vegetables like brinjal (2.9 MMT), cabbage (2.3 MMT), cauliflower (1.9 MMT), and potato (15.1 MMT) in 2020-21 (Horticulture Statistics). Emulating West Bengal’s model necessitates identifying Punjab’s own AEZs for horticulture.
Punjab’s dairy sector, contributing 28 per cent to its Gross Value agri-Output (GVO) in 2019-20, highlights its growth potential. This presents a golden opportunity for Punjab to capitalise on its existing dairy strength by venturing into value-added processing, from cheese to chocolates, for Indian and export markets.
The path towards revitalising Indian agriculture and boosting farmers’ incomes requires moving beyond traditional staples. Punjab and Haryana need to embrace a demand-driven high-value agricultural system, if they truly want their farmers to be prosperous. This would require shedding the mindset of an MSP-based cropping system.

It is this proficiency in cultivating high-value shrimp that boosts their profitability. This success story of AP serves as a compelling example for Punjab and Haryana if they want to switch from rice-wheat rotation.
Tamil Nadu sets a high bar for fruit cultivation, with mangoes and bananas comprising over 80 per cent of its fruit production in 2020-21. This success translates into a 39 per cent higher value creation in agriculture compared to their counterparts in Punjab. It is a clear signpost for Punjabi farmers’ higher income aspirations. But it is not just about diversifying into horticulture; it is also about embracing innovative agricultural practices.
For example, TN farmers practise Ultra High-Density Plantation (UHDP) for mangoes. This method allows 674 mango trees per acre compared to the traditional method of 40 only. This translates to a significant increase in yield and profits. This technique, being promoted by Jain Irrigation, leads to significant water savings (up to 50 per cent) and fertiliser savings (up to 30 per cent), further enhancing profitability.
West Bengal, a state with only 2 per cent agriculture power consumption in 2021-22, creates 40 per cent more value than Punjab, which gets free power for agriculture. WB cultivates vegetables on 15 per cent (1.5 Mha) of its GCA of 10.2 Mha. The central government’s recognition of this success is evident in the establishment of an Agri-Export Zone (AEZ) dedicated to vegetables in WB, encompassing three key districts: Nadia, Murshidabad, and North 24 Parganas. Year-round production of a variety of vegetables makes cropping intensity so high (199 per cent) in WB. The state has successfully transitioned from a “production-oriented” model to a more strategic “market-driven” system.
This focus on market demands is reflected in their impressive production figures for vegetables like brinjal (2.9 MMT), cabbage (2.3 MMT), cauliflower (1.9 MMT), and potato (15.1 MMT) in 2020-21 (Horticulture Statistics). Emulating West Bengal’s model necessitates identifying Punjab’s own AEZs for horticulture.
Punjab’s dairy sector, contributing 28 per cent to its Gross Value agri-Output (GVO) in 2019-20, highlights its growth potential. This presents a golden opportunity for Punjab to capitalise on its existing dairy strength by venturing into value-added processing, from cheese to chocolates, for Indian and export markets.
The path towards revitalising Indian agriculture and boosting farmers’ incomes requires moving beyond traditional staples. Punjab and Haryana need to embrace a demand-driven high-value agricultural system, if they truly want their farmers to be prosperous. This would require shedding the mindset of an MSP-based cropping system.

"RSS brings in its youngest ever No.3 rung leaders, with roots in Maharashtra, Jharkhand","Apart from infusing new blood, Atul Limaye and Alok Kumar are expected to shore up the Sangh in the two crucial states",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/RSS_f98faa.jpg?w=640,"Hosabale, who took over as RSS sarkaryavah in 2021, continues in the post, while senior RSS leader Manmohan Vaidya, who was sah sarkaryavah, has been moved to membership of the Sangh’s National Executive.","Ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, the RSS has added two new faces to its top leadership, with the induction of Atul Limaye and Alok Kumar as sah sarkaryavah (joint general secretary), at its Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha that concluded in Nagpur on Sunday.
This takes the total strength of joint general secretaries in the RSS to six. The appointments also underline the Sangh’s focus on Maharashtra and Jharkhand, where the BJP is looking to shore up its numbers.
In their 50s, Kumar and Limaye are the youngest infusion in the sah sarkaryavah group, which is No.3 in the Sangh hierarchy, after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale.
Hosabale, who took over as RSS sarkaryavah in 2021, continues in the post, while senior RSS leader Manmohan Vaidya, who was sah sarkaryavah, has been moved to membership of the Sangh’s National Executive.
Limaye belongs to Maharashtra and was the designated ‘kshetra pracharak’ of the Sangh in the western region, as part of which he is said to have overseen RSS work and expansion in Maharashtra, which also includes the RSS headquarters at Nagpur, apart from Gujarat and Goa.
“He is an old-timer who has spent a considerable number of years in Maharashtra and Gujarat. His elevation as sah sarkaryavah will strengthen the organisation in these two crucial states,” an RSS functionary said.
Alok Kumar has been the joint national publicity in-charge, and Sangh insiders admitted he was a surprise pick for the joint general secretary post. It is seen as part of the Sangh’s effort to infuse young energy in the top brass; it helps that he is based currently in Ranchi, Jharkhand, a state that the BJP sees as within its reach.
Hailing from western Uttar Pradesh, Kumar joined the Sangh in 1988 as a zila pracharak in Nainital. He then worked as vibhag pramukh in Haryana before becoming the prant pracharak of Meerut. In 2014, he was elevated as kshetra pracharak of western UP, with his jurisdiction extending to Uttarakhand.
Sources said Kumar was instrumental in deepening Sangh influence in the region, and is seen to have played a role in the BJP sweeping Lok Sabha polls in western UP.
Kumar has been replaced as joint national publicity in-charge with Pradeep Joshi, who has worked extensively in Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal and Odisha.
Apart from these changes, Jatin Kumar, who was the prant pracharak of Delhi, has been elevated as uttar kshetra pracharak. The ‘uttar kshetra’ includes Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.
Bharat Bhushan, the owner of Bharat Prakashan, who was prant karyavah in Delhi, has been appointed all-India sah sampark pramukh and would be working with sampark pramukh Ram Lal.
Anil Gupta has replaced Bharat Bhushan as prant karyavah.
Sunil Mehta has been appointed as boudhik pramukh (chief of intellectual wing) in place of Swant Ranjan, who has been appointed as pracharak pramukh.
Sunil Kulkarni, who was sharirik pramukh, has become sah pracharak pramukh."

From empowering Simi Garewal during a nude scene to bringing Sharmila Tagore’s shoot to a halt with his charm: Why Shashi Kapoor was adored by his co-stars,"On Shashi Kapoor's 86th birth anniversary, we peer into the life of one of Hindi cinema's most dashing actors through the eyes of his female co-stars, who celebrated his chivalry, kindness and honesty a little more than his striking looks.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/simi.jpg?w=640,Shashi Kapoor and Simi Garewal in a still from their 1972 film Siddhartha. (Pic: Express Archive),"On Koffee With Karan Season 8, Neetu Kapoor admitted to having a crush on her uncle Shashi Kapoor. Though her revelation was met with a shocking reaction from Karan Johar, Shashi’s female fans would probably be thinking, ‘Join the club!’ Despite being the least flamboyant of all the Kapoors during his era, Shashi Kapoor was widely regarded as one of the most handsome men in the film industry. However, his charm went beyond his looks. What truly endeared him to his female fans was his simplicity, honesty, family-oriented persona and his respectful demeanor towards his co-stars.
Shashi Kapoor’s female co-stars have often spoken about his supportive nature on sets, recalling instances that reflect his gentlemanly qualities. Let’s delve into some of these recollections:
When Shashi Kapoor gave confidence to Simi Garewal to shoot a partially nude scene
In Aseem Chhabra’s book “Shashi Kapoor: The Householder, The Star,” Simi Garewal recounted an instance from their 1972 film Siddhartha, where Shashi made her feel comfortable during a nude scene. Simi was nervous before the scene, but Shashi’s encouraging words gave her the confidence to proceed with grace and confidence.
“I can’t tell you how nervous I was before these scenes,” she said. “I finally wore a body-stocking from the waist down, but when I had to go topless, I was stricken. I couldn’t look up and just lowered my eyes. Shashi sensed what I was going through and said to me, ‘Don’t be shy, Simi. You are beautiful.’ Buoyed by his words, I found the courage to go through it all with confidence,” she said.
Zeenat Aman found Shashi Kapoor ‘devastatingly handsome’
Zeenat Aman’s admiration for Shashi Kapoor’s good looks began in her school days, long before she could have imagined sharing the screen with him. In an earlier interview, Zeenat reminisced about the time Shashi visited her school accompanied by his wife, Jennifer Kendal, to perform a play. Zeenat and her school friends were captivated by Shashi’s devastatingly handsome appearance. Remembering the same, she said, “I did some of my most enjoyable and unforgettable films with him. But before that, I remember when I was studying at the St Joseph’s Convent. Shashiji came with his wife to perform a play in our school. All of us schoolgirls were in a swoon. He was devastatingly handsome.”
Years later Zeenat and Shashi starred in one of the most-talked-about and controversial films of Hindi cinema – Satyam Shivam Sundaram. During the interaction, Zeenat recalled how despite being a mega star, Shashi was shy to take off his shirt while shooting for a song because he wasn’t confident about his physique. She said, “I remember Shashiji was shy about taking off his shirt under the waterfall in Satyam Shivam Sundaram when were shooting the song Yashomati maiya. He didn’t think he had the physique to pull it off.” Zeenat lauded Shashi for always being ‘gracious, warm, courteous and gentlemanly’ toward her during their time shooting together.
When Sharmila Tagore couldn’t concentrate when Shashi Kapoor was on set
While Zeenat Aman’s first meeting with Shashi Kapoor was in her school, veteran actor Sharmila Tagore met the actor for the first time on the sets of her film Kashmir Ki Kali, where she was shooting alongside Shashi’s brother, Shammi Kapoor. Despite Shammi’s own charm and charisma, Sharmila found herself unable to concentrate on her scenes due to her overwhelming attraction to Shashi’s good looks.
Recalling the experience, Sharmila said, “We were shooting the song ‘Isharon isharon mein’ with Shashi’s brother Shammi. I couldn’t concentrate on my romantic poses with Shammi. The director Shakti Samanta had to ask Shashi to leave.” She added, “I still remember how handsome he was. My God! He was the most handsome man I had seen.” Shashi Kapoor and Sharmila Tagore went on to star in many iconic films including Waqt, Aa Gale Lag Jaa, Aamne- Saamne, Suhana Safar and more.
He would pick up luggage of any lady he came across: Raakhee Gulzar
Raakhee Gulzar’s admiration for Shashi Kapoor extended beyond his on-screen persona. During the interview, Raakhee recounted instances where Shashi displayed acts of chivalry and kindness uncommon among Hindi cinema’s superstars.
She said, “I’ve never met a more cultured man. If we were on the airport he would pick up the vanity case and other luggage of any lady he came across. If there was a crowd at a shooting he would clear it for me to feel comfortable. These qualities I’ve never encountered in any of my heroes.”

The Ambani pre-wedding involved us all,"A complete lack of artifice, whether it was Anant Ambani’s speech or Radhika Merchant’s dance, made us all feel like we belonged",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/The-Jamnagar-jamboree-copy.jpg?w=640,"Far from employing covert tactics of stealth wealth or subtlety, the Ambanis transformed themselves into living legends by triumphantly occupying centre stage, revelling, in the heady gaze of mass adulation. (File Photo)","Recently, I attended a party where a guy stood at the entrance with a placard that said, “No pictures, please! Enjoy the party! Our photographer is in charge and will send you some.” The overzealous host’s explanation was that nobody lives in the moment anymore, and this business of capturing everything for posterity is highly overrated. While there’s some truth to that, rich people, aspiring to elegance and discernment, also feel compelled to do things differently. One inventive strategy, currently, is to hover above the fray of social media because, if projecting an image is the price of belonging, doesn’t denouncing Instagram become the ultimate status symbol? Something akin to the defining fashion trend of 2023, quiet luxury, or old-money aesthetic where design speaks through timeless cuts, not logo mania.
Contrast all these painstaking attempts at reverse snobbery with the splashy three-day, pre-nuptial extravaganza witnessed in Jamnagar. Far from employing covert tactics of stealth wealth or subtlety, the Ambanis transformed themselves into living legends by triumphantly occupying centre stage, revelling, in the heady gaze of mass adulation.
The fathomlessly rich in India, at least the ones who fancy themselves as sophisticated these days, prefer to shroud the details of their celebrations in secrecy. There are good reasons for this, namely, a certain, fiery, government department that has driven conspicuous consumption underground. Contrarily, the Ambanis invited every Indian to partake in their joy via many livestreams of the parties and relentless analyses on YouTube, dissecting everything from Mark Zuckerberg’s sequined tigress kurta to Mrs Ambani’s double-bricked emerald necklace (it can’t, in all seriousness, be dismissed as a mere precious stone). The dazzling 72-hour spectacle combined the pomp and splendour of erstwhile royals with a thoroughly modern approach to publicity; have it, flaunt it, own it, no holds barred. So, Jamnagar became an enchanted realm where stars and myth collided; after all, where else would Salman Khan, Rihanna and Akon unwind with an impromptu jig to the energetic beats of a dholak?
There are few people on earth and none in India who have the social capital to command the guest list the Ambanis did for the Jamnagar jamboree. The sole exception being, perhaps, Prime Minister Narendra Modi. However, that invite would be more like a summons a guest wouldn’t dare refuse. And indeed, while the PM may have a fearsome list of attributes to his credit, throwing a rocking party isn’t one of them. The Ambanis have operated within an exclusive though conservative sphere for decades, but recasting themselves as icons who know how to have fun has been the brainchild of Nita Ambani, clearly, the most formidable daughter-in-law in India.
It is worth noting that in an Indian context, traditional industrialists’ wives tend to fade into the background. They don’t register in the public imagination. Nobody even remembers the names of the Mrs Birlas or Mrs Adanis because the limelight is always on the husband. The wives too are content to be the invisible half who get the occasional spread in Hello! magazine, where their homes and designer wardrobes are displayed. It’s even rarer to find that gem of a man, delighted to be walking two steps behind his wife, perfectly at ease with the spotlight being on her rather than on him. To anyone watching, it seems Mukesh and Nita Ambani personify the ultimate partnership, playing to each other’s strengths while letting each other be.
How is it that the usual nasty barrage of opinion that floods X (formerly Twitter) after events of this scale is largely missing this time? Some comedians have had a field day, poking fun at the American tech giants wearing suits embellished with dragonflies, but it’s not mean or catty. And some jokes about billionaire problems are to be expected, and laughed at.
Let’s face it, rich people flashing their bucks aren’t easy to like but the Ambanis enjoy goodwill from all us strangers because everyone feels they’ve been taken along for the ride.
There’s something endearing about the complete lack of artifice; whether it was Anant Ambani’s soft-spoken, heartfelt speech or Radhika’s dance serenading him, they seem as at ease hosting a feast for thousands of villagers as they were with the noblesse who’d flown down on private jets. We live in a world where power is controlled on the principle of strict exclusion. The Jamnagar Jamboree was an unabashed celebration of fortune and fantasy with the difference being that those of us cheering from the sidelines felt we belonged.

Some comedians have had a field day, poking fun at the American tech giants wearing suits embellished with dragonflies, but it’s not mean or catty. And some jokes about billionaire problems are to be expected, and laughed at.
Let’s face it, rich people flashing their bucks aren’t easy to like but the Ambanis enjoy goodwill from all us strangers because everyone feels they’ve been taken along for the ride.
There’s something endearing about the complete lack of artifice; whether it was Anant Ambani’s soft-spoken, heartfelt speech or Radhika’s dance serenading him, they seem as at ease hosting a feast for thousands of villagers as they were with the noblesse who’d flown down on private jets. We live in a world where power is controlled on the principle of strict exclusion. The Jamnagar Jamboree was an unabashed celebration of fortune and fantasy with the difference being that those of us cheering from the sidelines felt we belonged.

‘BJP is like a dinosaur that doesn’t know its tail is being crushed’: ex-vice president Mahila Morcha,"Today, the BJP has become like a big dinosaur that does not know its tail is being crushed... The message will take time to travel to the brain through the nervous system in this huge body.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Jyoti.jpg?w=640,"Jyoti Pandya, Former National Vice-President, BJP Mahila Morcha (Express File Photo)","Jyoti Pandya, the former national vice-president of the BJP’s Mahila Morcha, was last week suspended by the party minutes before she held a press conference to voice her dissent against the nomination of sitting MP Ranjan Bhatt for the third time in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections from Vadodara.
In an exclusive interview with The Indian Express, Pandya, who has worked for 38 years in the party in various capacities, speaks on an array of issues related to Vadodara and the BJP, while not ruling out the possibility of fighting the elections as an independent. Excerpts:
Was it an impulsive decision to quit or one that came after long distress?
The feeling came a while ago… I had started feeling bad when women in the party would come and share their stories where they had been insulted or treated harshly. The feeling of disenchantment also started growing when I would often visit Surat as election incharge for the civic body, Assembly or other polls and see the developments there.
These were the seeds in my mind… but the third term for Ranjan (Bhatt) was the trigger. The party had taken my biodata twice in one week and I was very calm and confident as 10 years (of Bhatt’s tenure) is a sufficient time to prove inefficiency… My question is, what makes you do that (field Bhatt for a third term)? If it is stree-hath (obstinacy of a woman), I can also have it.
Would you have quit if the candidate would have been someone else but you?
If not for her, and if anyone else would have been the candidate, I would not have quit. I was given Mayorship (December 2010 to mid-2013) in the normal course as I was educated, young, dynamic and was giving my complete time to the party… What makes you select someone who is not performing? There is no dearth of leaders in Vadodara. New faces are required to continue the party… If you keep repeating the same people, the younger generation will think, ‘What are we doing here in the party.’
The party makes even the lowest rung of party workers work hard 24×7. They have to attend the party phone call, setting aside everything. If you do not do it, you are out! I am ageing now… I want to be somewhere.
Whom did you first call in the party to inform about your decision?
I spoke to (CR) Paatil saheb and (BJP state general secretary) Ratnakarji. Both answered my calls… Paatil sent Vijay Shah (Vadodara city President) and Balu Shukla (MLA Raopura and BJP Chief Whip in the Assembly) to speak to me, but I knew they were there for formality and they did not really want me to stay back… Paatil is mature but he works to achieve what has been asked of him.
Why did you say that BJP leaders are scared to speak out?
Everyone is being insulted so badly that they are scared to speak. You have to fall in line or get suspended. The ideology of the party has been compromised with the defections that are bringing in new people.
Today, the BJP has become like a big dinosaur that does not know its tail is being crushed… The message will take time to travel to the brain through the nervous system in this huge body.
The BJP I started with was a conviction and ideology-based party that respected commitment. Today, you cannot be sure if the commitment will be valued and if the people who have joined in now will show commitment.
You spoke about lack of development in Vadodara during the two-terms under Ranjan Bhatt. What did you mean?
I was always keen on infrastructure development — drinking water and drainage lines mix often. There is a lack of coordination within VMC (Vadodara Municipal Corporation) departments — they lay a pipeline network right after constructing and repairing a road. We need an international airport in Vadodara, which has not happened. We have Anand district in close proximity that has lakhs of international travellers, who have to travel all the way to Ahmedabad although Vadodara is closer. Why have we lacked the vision to expedite the international airport and get more travellers from Vadodara? Vadodara lost AIIMS and then we say that SSG hospital is overloaded due to patients from MP and Rajasthan… So why did we not get AIIMS? The Central government is set to give everything but the leaders of the city should have the vision to ask.
BJP’s city unit is often accused of interfering in the VMC work. Does it hamper the work?
It is true that they interfere a lot… If it is required, then you do it; but if each party office-bearer starts giving instructions, how will they (VMC officers) follow everything? Even in our house, the domestic help is not instructed by every member. There is a lack of literacy among leaders but maturity can help a lot. But leaders lack vision and selflessness. They are only working for vested interests and power. There is no collective thinking.
The communication gap between the administrative officers and the elected leaders is a problem.
The BJP has been the ruling party in the state for the last three decades but it is the collective will of genuine local leaders (that brings development). I have been talking for the last two days and so these issues have come out for public discussion. I knew if I speak, I will get suspended and finished. But I want to come up with the truth so that the leadership hears it.
Isn’t it true that Vadodara and Central Gujarat lack representation in the state government that also affects development?
CR Paatil was in Vadodara (for the inauguration of the Vadodara district party office) and said it would be good if the local leaders should pay heed to demands for development but within seven hours, he burdened the heads of the unit with the same inefficient candidate who has not been able to show any significant work in her decade-long tenure and needs to be discarded. They think of Vadodara leaders as gajar-mooli (insignificant like carrots and radishes)… Everytime Paatil comes to Vadodara, he makes instigating statements and leaves party factions in antagonism.
What genuine leadership are you referring to?
What is the meaning of genuine leadership? It means perceiving the problems and giving the right solution. For that you need teamwork, communication and skills to understand the organisation and aspiration of people. This genuine leadership is lacking somewhere. We know that IAS officers are declining postings in Vadodara.
The officers are qualified and skilled but they can only work with someone who understands the scope as well as limitations of the system. At the same time, you have to work with a time limit. Only genuine leaders will know this.
What makes Vadodara vote for the BJP in polls despite lacking development?
There are many pseudo leaders and people are looking for genuine leadership. If they get it, they will vote for someone else. People trust only (Narendra) Modiji because he is a genuine leader and he made a promise to Vadodara when he chose to hold Varanasi as his constituency but he is sending such a person to Vadodara who has failed… People vote for Modiji because he keeps coming here to assure them that he is there.
Will you contest the polls as an independent?
There are chances, but at this moment, I cannot commit to anything. But the situation is changing every minute and many people are contacting me… It is a scary picture as without a party’s backing, how will I do (contest the polls)? But I have a desire and if I get a good network, I might contest. If the people of Vadodara tell me to do something, I will do it. Right now, I have 70 per cent of my mind to work hard and make it happen."

"15-year-old girl on the run after murder of father, 8-year-old brother: Madhya Pradesh police","After the double murder came to light on Friday morning, the girl sent a voice note from her father’s phone to her cousin, police said, adding that they believed her to have gone missing at the time.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/eg_67f1f5.jpg?w=640,"After the relatives informed police, a team was dispatched to the girl's home, which was found locked from the outside.","Police in Madhya Pradesh are on the lookout for a 15-year-old girl they suspect to be involved in the murder of her 52-year-old father and eight-year-old brother in Jabalpur district.
After the double murder came to light on Friday morning, the girl sent a voice note from her father’s phone to her cousin, police said, adding that they believed her to have gone missing at the time.
After the relatives informed police, a team was dispatched to the girl’s home, which was found locked from the outside. When they broke open the door, police said they found the two bodies – the father on the floor and the eight-year-old boy stuffed in the fridge.
Police now suspect that the 15-year-old girl is on the run with a 19-year-old man, who had earlier been booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act following a complaint filed by the girl last year. He was arrested and served time in prison, but was later released on bail.
While police initially believed the 19-year-old man to be the sole suspect in the murders, officers say they now have CCTV footage to show that they are together.
Jabalpur Superintendent of Police (SP) Aditya Pratap Singh said, “Teams comprising our local police station and crime branch are on the lookout for the girl and the man.”
“We have analysed CCTV footage and their phone number. We managed to recover a scooty that was used by them to flee from the crime spot. We are working on the possible hideouts and we will soon arrest both the accused. They are both together,” Singh said.
The two accused were spotted at Madan Mahal Railway Station, where they abandoned their vehicle, before taking an autorickshaw and heading to the bus stand, from where they boarded a bus to flee Jabalpur, police said."

Al-Hilal’s record winning streak does not make them hall of famers,"That Al-Hilal has won 28 games in a row only points to the lack of competitive edge in the Saudi league; since its inception in 1974, Al-Hilal have been crowned champions 18 times, while a 19th title is sealed.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Al-Hilal.jpg?w=640,Al-Hilal extended their winning streak to 29 after they beat Damac 2-1. (Reuters),"Whatever the future of the Saudi Pro League be, Al-Hilal has achieved a slice of history. When they beat Al-Ittihad last week, they grabbed the record for the longest winning streak in the game’s record books. The record would be widely contested and criticized, but it was just the sort of positive publicity the league needed at a time when it was slipping out of football consciousness after the million-dollar storm it had whipped up since the acquisition of Cristiano Ronaldo last year and the subsequent exodus of Europe’s elite players.
Winning 28 games on the spin is a monumental feat anywhere in the world. But it comes with caveats, as records often tend to. Broadly speaking, there are two factors to weigh in. A) Is it truly the record? There of course would be claimants. For instance, FK Akradag, a club founded by former president of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, who himself designed the logo, last year went on a 33-game winning streak. In fact, they have won every game they have played. But the obscurity of the league, the uncertainty of its quality and the doubts over its integrity, as the ruler of the country is Berdymukhamedov’s son Serdar, were enough for the Guinness Book of Records (it’s not FIFA that approves the records) to cast aspersions on the nature and level of competitions.
In the post World War Two Era, Hungarian club Ujpest reportedly won 30 games in a row, but information of games in that era is sketchy.
Diligent recording of data in football began late, a reason several records are subject to debates. For instance, Pele’s goal tally of 1,279 strikes in 1,363 games, was fervently disputed, as many of the goals had arrived in celebratory games after retirement. He played 550 unofficial games, some of them against U-23 national teams (among them Saudi’s too), combined squads, regional teams and even in some military events while he served in the Brazilian army. In total, it’s believed that more than 500 of Pelé’s goals came in unofficial matches. “Who did you score them against?” Maradona once asked in an interview with Pele in a television program years ago. “Your nephews in the backyard?”
The second caveat dribbles in. Is the number really glittering, given the standard of the league?
The previous record, after all, was held by a little-known club on the Wales-England border The New Saints of Oswestry Town & Llansantffraid Football Club. They had beaten the record of surpassing Ajax’s 26 consecutive wins in the early 1970s when Johan Cruyff was their figurehead. In terms of quality and competitiveness of the league, Ajax’s achievement is considered the benchmark. And for the number to add glitter, the feat has to be achieved in the top five leagues of Europe. It would be an inhuman feat considering the ultra- cut-throatiness of the leagues. The closest any team has come to matching Ajax is Ajax itself, in 1994-95, the sparkling batch of Clarence Seedorf, Edgar Davids, Edwin van der Sar and Marc Overmars, an imperious batch won both the league and Champions League, dethroning AC Milan. Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Manchester City all came close in recent years, but fell short, demonstrating the difficulty of sustaining a winning streak in Europe.
Not that what Al Hilal achieved is trivial but it lacks the grandeur of the Ajax sides. It becomes a mere statistical embellishment, and not a sign of greatness. There are similar numbers and accomplishments that remain as mere figures. The name Erwin Helmchen might not ring a bell. But the German, who played in the 1930s, is the highest goal-scorer ever in league football. According to RSSSF statistics, the most authoritative stats engine for football records, he has scored 947 goals. But he is not talked about as one of the greatest-ever strikers, because the era he lived and played the game was different. Between Peter Shilton and Cristiano Ronaldo in the list of most appearances for clubs are Brazil’s Fabio (1311) and England’s Paul Bastock (1286), both goalkeepers aged 43 and 53 still plying in the lower leagues of their country. Neither strike a chord.
Every record and number thus needs contextualising. What can be gathered from Al-Hilal’s streak is that they enjoy a disturbing monopoly. Since its inception in 1974, they have been crowned champions 18 times, a 19th is on the way, as the sit 12 points adrift of Al Nassr, the club of Cristiano Ronaldo fame, have been Asian champions four times, a record. They have won five of the past seven titles, and seem destined to bag their sixth in eight seasons. They are Saudi’s best ever. No doubt. But the record doesn’t make them hall of famers.
Teams around them can learn. This season, they were the merriest spenders—shelling out 376.10 million pounds, 90 million spent on Neymar alone — but they were also the sharpest ones because they invested on players who have not yet slipped into their autumn. Neymar (who missed most of the season) is just 32, Milinkovic-Savic 29, Neves and Malcolm 27. All of them were aggressively chased by the giants of Europe, but could not match the Saudi giants in spending powers. They have played with clarity and intensity. They have set the standards, but unless the clubs around lift themselves, the impressive numbers they have been racking would remain of mere academic use. A trivia at best."

Between Peter Shilton and Cristiano Ronaldo in the list of most appearances for clubs are Brazil’s Fabio (1311) and England’s Paul Bastock (1286), both goalkeepers aged 43 and 53 still plying in the lower leagues of their country. Neither strike a chord.
Every record and number thus needs contextualising. What can be gathered from Al-Hilal’s streak is that they enjoy a disturbing monopoly. Since its inception in 1974, they have been crowned champions 18 times, a 19th is on the way, as the sit 12 points adrift of Al Nassr, the club of Cristiano Ronaldo fame, have been Asian champions four times, a record. They have won five of the past seven titles, and seem destined to bag their sixth in eight seasons. They are Saudi’s best ever. No doubt. But the record doesn’t make them hall of famers.
Teams around them can learn. This season, they were the merriest spenders—shelling out 376.10 million pounds, 90 million spent on Neymar alone — but they were also the sharpest ones because they invested on players who have not yet slipped into their autumn. Neymar (who missed most of the season) is just 32, Milinkovic-Savic 29, Neves and Malcolm 27. All of them were aggressively chased by the giants of Europe, but could not match the Saudi giants in spending powers. They have played with clarity and intensity. They have set the standards, but unless the clubs around lift themselves, the impressive numbers they have been racking would remain of mere academic use. A trivia at best."
Delhi Court allows jailed AAP leader Sanjay Singh to take oath as Rajya Sabha MP,Sanjay Singh was arrested in October 2023 in connection with the Delhi excise policy case and denied summons to take oath after his re-election as a Rajya Sabha MP.,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/01/sanjay-singh-aap.jpg?w=640,AAP MP Sanjay Singh.,"A Delhi Court recently granted permission to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Sanjay Singh, an accused in the Delhi excise policy case, to appear before the Parliament on Tuesday to take oath as a Rajya Sabha member. Singh was recently elected to Rajya Sabha for a second term but denied summons to take oath.
The court of Special Judge M K Nagpal also directed the Tihar jail authorities to ensure that the accused is taken to Parliament under adequate security and that he is not permitted to use his phone or talk to other accused persons.
Singh was arrested on October 4, 2023, following 10 hours of searches at his North Avenue home. He was the third AAP leader to be arrested in the case, following former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and the party’s communications in-charge Vijay Nair.
The ED alleged that an accused businessman, Dinesh Arora, who later turned approver in the excise case, had given Singh Rs 2 crore in cash. It also alleged that Singh had ensured changes were made in the liquor policy through Sisodia to favour certain businessmen.
Calling Singh a “key conspirator”, the ED, in its remand application, had said: “Sanjay Singh has exploited and gained illegal money/ kickbacks, which is ‘proceeds of crime’ generated from the liquor policy (2021-22) scam…(he) has been part of the conspiracy of collecting kickbacks from liquor groups…(he) has a close relationship with Dinesh Arora since 2017 as revealed by Dinesh Arora as well as from his call records."

"Can salt substitutes reduce your high blood pressure by 40 per cent? Understanding who needs it, who doesn’t",A cardiologist explains a new study and the best ways to incorporate salt substitutes in your diet,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/salt.jpg?w=640,"Some new types of salt substitutes are being developed using ingredients like herbs, spices, garlic and citrus fruits. (Source: Freepik)","Can salt substitutes help in controlling hypertension? A recent study, conducted by Chinese scientists, found that replacing table salt with a salt substitute reduced the incidence of hypertension (high blood pressure) by 40 per cent without increasing hypotension (low blood pressure) episodes.
The salt substitute contained 25 per cent potassium chloride — which doesn’t raise blood pressure — and 12 per cent dried food flavourings such as mushroom, lemon, seaweed, hawthorn, and wild jujube, as well as traces of amino acids.
Explaining the findings, Dr Vanita Arora, senior consultant, cardiac electrophysiologist and interventional cardiologist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi, says while salt substitutes can reduce dietary sodium from sodium chloride-based table salt, they too need to be used moderately.
What are salt substitutes and how do they differ from normal table salt?
Salt substitutes are seasoning products used to replace regular salt. The most common flavour substitute is potassium chloride though some brands use potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate or potassium lactate instead. Sodium increases blood volume and blood pressure while potassium helps to lower and regulate blood pressure. So it neutralises or counteracts the hypertensive effects of sodium. Some new types of salt substitutes are being developed using ingredients like herbs, spices, garlic and citrus fruits.
Can salt substitutes become effective in controlling hypertension? Are there any risk factors?
Yes. Studies show that decreasing sodium intake while simultaneously raising potassium intake can effectively lower elevated blood pressure, especially for those sensitive to salt.
But they may not work on those who are suffering from kidney disorders or taking specific medications as excessive potassium can be dangerous for them. Besides, salt substitutes should be just one piece of a comprehensive high blood pressure management plan that should equally focus on lifestyle changes like exercise, weight loss and having a balanced diet. Effects differ from individual to individual, so it is important to consult a physician before including salt substitutes.
Who can have salt substitutes? Who should not?
About 75 per cent of sodium-sensitive individuals with high blood pressure are over the age of 55. Those over 50 years with a family history of high blood pressure can have salt substitutes to lower chances of developing hypertension. Older adults (65+years) can use them to prevent cardiovascular conditions.
The use of salt substitutes is generally not necessary or even recommended for healthy children and adolescents as they require sodium for growth and development. People with normal blood pressure don’t need to opt for substitutes. According to public health guidelines, the WHO-recommended sodium intake for a healthy adult is around 2000 mg per day, which can reasonably come from use of common salt equivalent to 5 g/day or just under a teaspoon.
If I have hypertension, should I start consuming salt substitutes to control my blood pressure?
You can but do not simply start consuming salt substitutes on your own without consulting your physician."

7 Reasons to Choose Bajaj Finserv Gold Loan to Meet Your Financial Needs,"Obtain loans ranging from Rs. 5000 to Rs. 2 crore, with interest rates starting at a mere 9.50% per annum, ensuring you can effortlessly address both planned and unforeseen expenses.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Gold-LEAD-2.jpg?w=640,7 Reasons to Choose Bajaj Finserv Gold Loan to Meet Your Financial Needs,"In the realm of financial solutions, gold loans stand out as a versatile and accessible option for individuals seeking quick access to funds. With the enduring value of gold and the simplicity of the loan process, opting for a gold loan presents numerous advantages for borrowers facing diverse financial circumstances. Whether it’s for meeting urgent expenses, funding a new venture, or managing unforeseen financial challenges, the benefits of a gold loan make it a compelling choice for those in need of financial assistance.
Here is a list of features that make gold loans a wise financial solution:
Gold loans are a popular credit facility that offer a high loan value in exchange for 22-karat gold jewellery. Bajaj Finance offers loans ranging from Rs. 5,000 up to Rs. 2 crore with interest rates starting at 9.50% per annum. As per RBI guidelines, you may receive up to 75% of the total market value of your gold jewellery.
You can also use an online gold loan calculator to calculate your repayment options based on the weight of your gold jewellery, loan amount, or interest rate before taking a loan.
One of the primary benefits of applying for a gold loan is the quick processing time. Unlike most secured loans, a gold loan requires minimal paperwork, and the loan can be disbursed within a few hours of application. This is comparatively faster than traditional loan facilities, where you may have to wait for days or even weeks to get access to funds. 
Another benefit of a gold loan is the lower gold loan interest rate. Since the loan is secured against gold, the risk to the lender is lower, which results in lower interest rates compared to other types of loans. This makes it an affordable option for borrowers.
Since gold loans are secured loans, you do not need a high CIBIL Score to avail them. You only need gold jewellery that meets the required standards for the loan to be sanctioned. This makes gold loans a great choice if you have no credit history or a low credit score.
Gold loans offer multiple repayment options. You can choose the tenure of the loan and the repayment schedule according to your financial capacity. You can either pay regular instalments or pay interest monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or on an annual basis as per your convenience. This makes it easier for you to repay the loan without any financial strain.
Most gold loans do not have any part-prepayment fees. This means you can repay the loan before the tenure ends, without paying any extra charges. This is a significant benefit for those who can repay the loan before the due date.
The absence of end-use restrictions is a major advantage of gold loans, as you have the flexibility to use the loan amount for any purpose you desire. This makes gold loans a popular choice for those who require quick access to funds without any restrictions on how they can be used. 
How to apply for a gold loan
When it comes to a Bajaj Finserv Gold Loan, you can apply if you are an Indian citizen aged between 21 and 70 years. Just get your KYC documents and you are good to go. 
All you need to do is walk into a Bajaj Finserv branch near you. You can also apply online from the comfort of your own home by going to the Bajaj Finserv website and following these easy steps:
Once done, you will receive a call from their representative to confirm your appointment and guide you on the next steps. 
It’s really that simple. Visit the Bajaj Finance website to apply for your gold loan and manage your expenses with ease.

Is face shaving the answer to all your skin problems?,"Face shaving has picked up as a trend on social media with many claiming to have experienced its benefits. But, is it really good for your skin?",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/face-shaving-1-2.jpg?w=640,"While face shaving comes with several benefits, it is important to consider the problems that may arise from the use of this technique. (Source: Freepik)","Until the recent digital wave, the concept of a woman wielding a blade to shave her face was almost unheard-of. Many influencers claim to have reaped the benefits of shaving after achieving supple and radiant skin from the practice, allowing for a smooth surface for makeup and skincare products to glide. 
While this trendy ritual may seem attractive from the outset, providing a quick fix to get rid of facial hair, there are complications that can arise if people make uninformed decisions just for the sake of following a popular trend. 
Dr Meghna Mour, aesthetic dermatologist, cosmetologist, trichologist, laser specialist and founder of Skuccii Supercliniq, says that there are multiple benefits of face shaving. It helps absorb skincare products more effectively, preserves collagen production in the skin as well as blurs out visible fine lines and wrinkles over time.
However, Dr. Rashmi Aderao, dermatology consultant at Ruby Hall Clinic Pune, warns that using an incorrect technique can lead to a myriad of skin problems including redness, irritation, or razor burn. Dr Mour agrees, “Using a dull razor, shaving too aggressively, or neglecting to moisturise afterwards can worsen these risks.”
It is no secret that the beauty and skincare industry is massive today, and in the pursuit of that coveted ‘glass skin’ glow that finds its way into our social media feeds almost daily, many would want to try shaving their faces in order to achieve that perfect glow. But nothing can beat being knowledgeable about what you are putting your skin through. That is why Dr Dinyar Workingboxwalla, skin guru, Beauty by BiE recommends proceeding with caution, especially if you have sensitive and acne prone skin. “Shaving can aggravate these conditions. If you must try, do a patch test first and use a single-blade razor with a super gentle touch,” he stresses. 
Dr Rinky Kapoor, dermatologist and director, The Esthetic Clinics, recommends women to use “special dermaplaning tools” to shave their face.
Face shaving comes with several benefits; but it is important to consider the problems that may arise from the use of this technique. If you have skin concerns, then it is best to consult a dermatologist first or go for safer options like threading and waxing. “Over-shaving or using harsh techniques can lead to damage to the skin barrier and increased sensitivity over time. Women should aim for a balanced approach and prioritise skin health above all else,” Dr Workingboxwalla informs."
Indian startups on track to raise $8-12 billion this year: Venture capital firm Peak XV,"Speaking at StartUp Mahakumbh, Peak XV Managing Director Rajan Anandan said around USD 20 billion of private capital is lying uninvested and is committed for investment in private firms and startups in India.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Untitled-design-2024-03-18T124415.072.jpg?w=640,,"Indian startups are expected to raise USD 8-12 billion this year, a top official of venture capital firm Peak XV said on Monday, highlighting that the country’s startup ecosystem is the most vibrant in the world.
Speaking at StartUp Mahakumbh, Peak XV Managing Director Rajan Anandan said around USD 20 billion of private capital is lying uninvested and is committed for investment in private firms and startups in India.
Anandan said that the investment run rate in Indian startups before 2021 and 2022, was about USD 8-10 billion, which increased to USD 60 billion in 2021 and 2022 combined.
“Last year, it was USD 7 billion, which people said is low. It could have been zero because basically six years of funding came in two years.This year we are well on track to USD 8-10 or 12 billion. We are going to have an ecosystem which is going to have USD 10-12 billion for few years and it will go at natural pace that it should,” Anandan said.
He said that USD 10 billion or about Rs 80,000 crore funding per year is enough to build the Indian startup ecosystem.
Citing shift in focus of funding in the US to AI and next generation software entities, Anandan said the Indian startup ecosystem is the most vibrant ecosystem in the world.
He said that his firm last year made investments in consumer businesses which are no longer getting funded in the US.
“India today has 20 startups that are being publicly traded. We think that over the next 7-8 years, there will be 100 startups that will go public,” Anandan said.
He indicated that growth in funding is coming back across funding stages.

Chandrakant Patil urges BJP cadre to work against Sharad Pawar in Baramati: ‘time to take revenge’,"Shrinivas Pawar, brother of Ajit Pawar, stands by his uncle, and says the BJP always wanted to finish Sharad Pawar in politics.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/baramati-lok-sabha.jpg?w=640,"The Nationalist Congress Party led by Ajit Pawar has launched an intense election campaign against Supriya Sule, the sitting MP and candidate of NCP (SP), in Baramati. (File Photos)","After prominent BJP and Shiv Sena leaders in the Baramati parliamentary constituency spoke out against Ajit Pawar publicly, senior BJP leader Chandrakant Patil decided to take the reins of the Lok Sabha election campaign in Baramati in support of the NCP.
Even as Patil urged party cadres to take revenge against NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar) chief Sharad Pawar by voting for the candidate Ajit Pawar would field on the Baramati seat, Shrinivas Pawar, brother of Ajit Pawar, has come in support of his uncle Sharad Pawar.
The Nationalist Congress Party led by Ajit Pawar has launched an intense election campaign against Supriya Sule, the sitting MP and candidate of NCP (SP), in Baramati with Sunetra Pawar, Sule’s sister-in-law and the wife of Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, as the possible candidate of NCP. The NCP, which is part of the NDA, had reportedly raised concern over the leaders of BJP and Shiv Sena led by Eknath Shinde not cooperating in the election campaign.
Now, Chandrakant Patil, who is the coordinator of NDA for four Lok Sabha seats of Pune, Baramati, Shirur, and Maval, is leading from the front to activate the cadres of the BJP in Baramati.
While addressing the party cadres in Baramati on Sunday, Patil said, “Sharad Pawar has twice cheated the BJP and its leaders to form an alliance government in the state. The distribution of ministries and posts of guardian ministers were finalised but Sharad Pawar backed out saying the party cadre won’t agree to the alliance”.
“This is only one per cent of the secret. I am saying this as I can’t disclose everything. Thus, it is the time to take revenge for the insult and cheating done by Sharad Pawar of BJP and its leaders. It should be done by voting for the candidate of Ajit Pawar in Baramati,” the Maharashtra minister said after visiting Sunetra Pawar at her residence in Baramati.
His visit came after BJP leader Harshvardhan Patil openly spoke about the threat by leaders of alliance parties (NCP) to him over moving about in the Indapur constituency. He has been holding party meetings but seeking support for forthcoming Assembly polls instead of the Lok Sabha elections. Shiv Sena leader Vijay Shivtare has also publicly declared he would teach Ajit Pawar a lesson during the Lok Sabha elections 2024 for the treatment meted out to him by the NCP in the past.
On his part, Shrinivas Pawar, Ajit Pawar’s brother, has come out in support of his uncle Sharad Pawar. At a meeting with villagers in Baramati, he said the BJP and RSS want to finish the career of Sharad Pawar and they have been trying this for long. “We are aware of the contribution of Sharad Pawar in the progress of Baramati. It was wrong to leave him alone in this situation,” he said.
He also said that if someone loans a farm for tilling doesn’t mean the one farming owns the land in an indirect reference to Ajit Pawar being given the responsibility of Baramati in the past.
Meanwhile, Shrinivas Pawar’s son Yugendra Pawar has already started campaigning for Supriya Sule in Baramati.
NCP (SP) legislator and grandnephew of Sharad Pawar, Rohit Pawar said the stand taken by Shrinivas Pawar is the stand of the common public. “The Pawar family has over 100 members and all follow the same ideology. It is Ajit Pawar, his wife, and two sons who have decided to go another way so they have isolated themselves from the rest of the Pawar family. The Pawar family was united and will always remain together,” he said."
"Kejriwal skips ED summons in Delhi Jal Board case; BJP wants to fight Lok Sabha polls hiding behind ED, says AAP","In February, the ED searched various locations in Delhi, Varanasi and Chandigarh in connection with the Delhi Jal Board case, including premises linked to Arvind Kejriwal's personal assistant Bibhav Kumar.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/kejriwal_3b1a0e.jpg?w=640,Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday skipped the summons issued by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday in connection with alleged irregularities in the Delhi Jal Board. (File Photo),"Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday skipped the summons issued by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday in connection with alleged irregularities in the Delhi Jal Board (DJB). This is the first time that Kejriwal has been summoned by the central investigating agency in the case.
Calling the summons illegal, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders said it was another attempt by the BJP to use the ED to threaten the party. “When the CM has been granted bail by court, why is the ED sending summonses repeatedly? These are illegal. Why does the BJP want to contest the Lok Sabha polls hiding behind the ED?,” party leaders asked.
In February, the central agency had conducted raids at various locations in Delhi, Varanasi and Chandigarh in connection with the case, including at premises linked to Kejriwal’s personal assistant Bibhav Kumar and AAP Rajya Sabha MP N D Gupta. The agency has arrested retired DJB chief engineer Jagdish Kumar Arora and contractor Anil Kumar Aggarwal in the case.
The ED’s case is based on an FIR registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for offences related to alleged corruption and bribery in the DJB. It alleged that a contract to install electromagnetic flow meters was given to a company at “inflated” rates and the extra money was then paid as “bribes”, including to people linked with the AAP and to the party as “election funds”. The AAP has denied the allegations.
The BJP, meanwhile, said Arvind Kejriwal was evading questions because the allegations of corruption against him are true. “Kejriwal has evaded investigation yet again. Now it is clear that he is corrupt and something fishy is going on at the DJB,” Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said."
Guide to buying used tablet in India: A 4-step checklist,Planning to buy a refurbished tablet? Here are some things you should look out for before spending your hard earned money.,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Used-tablet-buying-guide.jpg?w=640,Refurbished tablets can help you save a lot of money. (Express Photo),"Tablets are great for both work and play, covering the middle ground between smartphones and laptops. For those on a budget or looking for a deal that offers great value for money, buying a used tablet might be better than purchasing a new one. If you are thinking about buying a refurbished tablet, here are some things you should look out for.
One of the most important things when buying a used or refurbished product is to check it for physical damage and ensure that it is in good condition. Since tablets have huge screens, the first thing to inspect is the display.
While minor scratches won’t have any effect on functionality if the previous owner has installed a screen protector, if you spot a crack, ask them to remove it to check if the glass is cracked or if it is just the protector.
If the tablet is in a cover, remove it and check the back panel and the corners for any dents, deformations or scratches.
Buying a refurbished tablet instead of a new one will save you a ton of money, but before you do, make sure the model you purchase packs the hardware you intend to use it for.
You can do so by checking reviews of the tablet online, manually determining if the screen is crisp and bright enough for your needs and checking the software support from the manufacturer’s website.
Also, make sure that the tablet has been factory reset before you purchase it. Some tablets may still ask for the previous owner’s password, so if you are buying it from someone, make sure you remove that and set your password.
Before you decide to buy a second-hand tablet, make sure you have checked the device for hardware defects. If the tablet you are going to buy has an AMOLED screen, download an app to see if it has any dead pixels or burn-in. While spotting dead pixels may require a third-party app, screen burn-ins are pretty easy to spot.
Another thing to check is if the speakers are fine and working. Before purchasing the device, try to play music at the highest volume to see if the audio is cracking. If it is, chances are pretty high that the speakers are damaged. Most modern tablets come with a front and rear camera, so when purchasing a used one, open the camera app to check for any defects.
Tablets typically have an all-day battery life, but older ones may have a degraded battery that will barely last a day. If you are buying from an individual, you can ask them how long the battery lasts for them, but those purchasing from an online platform or seller should reach out to the refurbisher to learn more about the battery health.
Some tablets may have a loose or damaged charging port, so make sure you check it by inserting the charging cable and checking if the connector is working without a problem.
If you are purchasing the device from an online seller or a store that sells refurbished devices, make sure they either have a return policy or offer at least three to six months of warranty after making the purchase.
In most cases, this may not be as useful, but some hardware and software problems may take a few days to appear, so make sure you can return or ask the seller to repair the device in case it is acting up.

Bengaluru jewellery store heist bid: 4 arrested from Gwalior,The jewellery owner and a staff member sustained injuries during the robbery bid in Bengaluru on March 14.,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/bengaluru-jewellery-theft.jpg?w=640,Four men were arrested by Bengaluru police for attempting to rob a jewellery store in Gwalior. (Express Photo),"The Bengaluru police on Sunday said they arrested four men from Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh in connection with a robbery attempt at a jewellery store in the city last week.
The robbery attempt at Laxmi Bankers and Jewellers in Devinagar occurred around 11 am on March 14 when three masked assailants stormed the premises while a fourth waited outside, said the police. They allegedly ordered the staff to package the gold while one assailant loaded bullets into a homemade pistol.
Laxmi Bankers owner Appuram and a staff member Abhiram allegedly sustained injuries in the attack. A police officer said, “One of the accused loading the pistol hit Abhiram’s head, and by then, Appuram activated a siren, prompting one of the assailants to open fire with his pistol. The blaring siren alerted nearby shopkeepers, causing the assailants to flee hastily, leaving behind a pistol outside the shop.”
The police tracked the movement of the accused, leading to the arrests. They identified the arrested accused as Suraj, Ashu Pandit, Khana Pandit, and Vikas. The police said they suspect the involvement by a local resident who was absent from the scene during the shooting.
The police, however, quashed rumours of a firing incident in Madhya Pradesh before the arrests. The accused would be brought to Bengaluru soon, said a senior police officer."

"Can salt substitutes reduce your high blood pressure by 40 per cent? Understanding who needs it, who doesn’t",A cardiologist explains a new study and the best ways to incorporate salt substitutes in your diet,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/salt.jpg?w=640,"Some new types of salt substitutes are being developed using ingredients like herbs, spices, garlic and citrus fruits. (Source: Freepik)","Can salt substitutes help in controlling hypertension? A recent study, conducted by Chinese scientists, found that replacing table salt with a salt substitute reduced the incidence of hypertension (high blood pressure) by 40 per cent without increasing hypotension (low blood pressure) episodes.
The salt substitute contained 25 per cent potassium chloride — which doesn’t raise blood pressure — and 12 per cent dried food flavourings such as mushroom, lemon, seaweed, hawthorn, and wild jujube, as well as traces of amino acids.
Explaining the findings, Dr Vanita Arora, senior consultant, cardiac electrophysiologist and interventional cardiologist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi, says while salt substitutes can reduce dietary sodium from sodium chloride-based table salt, they too need to be used moderately.
What are salt substitutes and how do they differ from normal table salt?
Salt substitutes are seasoning products used to replace regular salt. The most common flavour substitute is potassium chloride though some brands use potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate or potassium lactate instead. Sodium increases blood volume and blood pressure while potassium helps to lower and regulate blood pressure. So it neutralises or counteracts the hypertensive effects of sodium. Some new types of salt substitutes are being developed using ingredients like herbs, spices, garlic and citrus fruits.
Can salt substitutes become effective in controlling hypertension? Are there any risk factors?
Yes. Studies show that decreasing sodium intake while simultaneously raising potassium intake can effectively lower elevated blood pressure, especially for those sensitive to salt.
But they may not work on those who are suffering from kidney disorders or taking specific medications as excessive potassium can be dangerous for them. Besides, salt substitutes should be just one piece of a comprehensive high blood pressure management plan that should equally focus on lifestyle changes like exercise, weight loss and having a balanced diet. Effects differ from individual to individual, so it is important to consult a physician before including salt substitutes.
Who can have salt substitutes? Who should not?
About 75 per cent of sodium-sensitive individuals with high blood pressure are over the age of 55. Those over 50 years with a family history of high blood pressure can have salt substitutes to lower chances of developing hypertension. Older adults (65+years) can use them to prevent cardiovascular conditions.
The use of salt substitutes is generally not necessary or even recommended for healthy children and adolescents as they require sodium for growth and development. People with normal blood pressure don’t need to opt for substitutes. According to public health guidelines, the WHO-recommended sodium intake for a healthy adult is around 2000 mg per day, which can reasonably come from use of common salt equivalent to 5 g/day or just under a teaspoon.
If I have hypertension, should I start consuming salt substitutes to control my blood pressure?
You can but do not simply start consuming salt substitutes on your own without consulting your physician."
Full list of tax-saving schemes as current financial year set to end,"Efficient income tax planning is a crucial aspect of financial management. It aims to minimise tax liabilities and increase savings. With the fiscal year FY23–24 ending on March 31, 2024, it is an excellent time to consider tax-saving investment options that can boost disposable income.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/ie.com-thumbnails.jpg?w=640,"Save Taxes in FY 2023–24: Explore some of the tax-saving schemes to invest in before March 31st, 2024. (Source: Canva)","The financial year in India begins on April 1st and ends on March 31st of the following year. With the deadline for tax-saving investments for the financial year 2023–24 fast approaching, it’s essential to start thinking about investments if one hasn’t already.
For the majority of salaried employees, taxes may have already been deducted by the employers in January and February.
However, for those who still need to make investments, the government of India offers numerous opportunities for savings and expenses through the Income Tax Act, which can significantly reduce tax liabilities and increase savings.
Investing in tax-saving schemes is a crucial aspect of financial planning strategy and management. It can help individuals meet their financial goals by maximising tax benefits and increasing disposable income.
Here are some tax-saving investment options that one can consider before March 31st to save on taxes and increase their savings in the new financial year.
1. Home loans:
One can avail of the tax benefits on home loans under Section 80C and Section 24(b) of the Income Tax Act, as it enables one to save tax on the principal repayment amount of a home loan and the interest paid.
Individuals can avail of tax deductions up to Rs 1.5 lakh for principal repayments on home loans under Section 80C and even get exemptions on home loan interest payments up to Rs 2 lakh annually under Section 24(b).
Furthermore, renting out the newly purchased home can exempt one from the entire interest component in annual income tax computations. Section 80EEA allows one to claim an additional reduction in the annual tax liability, given that one is a first-time homeowner.
2. Health insurance or Mediclaim:
Health insurance, or Mediclaim, is known for providing coverage for expenses incurred before and after an accident or hospitalisation, up to the specified sum assured. Individuals can avail of tax benefits under Section 80D for the portion of their annual taxable income used for premium payments. However, the amount exempt from income tax depends on the age of the insured person; for senior citizens, insurance premiums are up to Rs 20,000, while for others, the limit is Rs 15,000.
3. Tax-loss harvesting:
Tax-loss harvesting under the Income Tax Act of 1961 allows new investors to minimise and save from tax liability by offsetting capital gains with capital losses. As up to Rs 1 lakh in long-term capital gains are tax-free, this strategy involves selling underperforming investments to realise losses, which can be used to offset taxable capital gains made from other investments.
4. Government schemes:
There are several government-mandated investment schemes available that offer high returns on investments and tax waivers, which can help individuals claim up to Rs. 1.5 lakh on their total annual income under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.
To avail of tax exemptions, individuals can invest in several tools, such as:
5. Life Insurance:
Section 80C of the Income Tax Act allows for tax deductions on premium payments for life insurance policies. Under Section 10(10D), the maturity proceeds or death benefits received from the insurance policy are tax-free.
However, for policies issued after April 1, 2012, the annual premium must be less than 10% of the sum assured to claim deductions up to Rs 1.5 lakh under Section 80C. For policies issued before April 1, 2012, the premium should be at most 20% of the sum assured to be eligible for the same deduction.
Additionally, Section 80CCC provides tax exemptions up to Rs 1.5 lakh for the purchase, renewal, or annuity payments of life insurance policies through monthly salary.
6. Tax-saving Mutual Funds:
Section 80C of the Income Tax Act allows individuals to save tax with mutual funds, commonly referred to as equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS), with a limit of up to Rs 1.5 lakh. Additionally, the proceeds from maturity or death are exempt from tax under Section 10(D). These funds primarily invest in equities and are appropriate for investors with a moderate to high-risk tolerance; however, they have a three-year lock-in period.
7. Unit-Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP):
ULIPs offer a long-term investment opportunity, allowing investors to choose between equity and debt funds or a combination of both under sections 80C and 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act of 1961.
8. National Savings Certificate (NSC):
National Savings Certificates are a government savings bond scheme designed to encourage small to medium-income investors to save while availing of tax benefits under Section 80C.
9. Tax Saver Fixed Deposit:
Investing in tax-saver fixed deposits allows you to claim a tax deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961, up to Rs. 1.5 lakh. These fixed deposits have a mandatory lock-in period of 5 years, and the interest earned is taxable, ranging from 5.5% to 7.75%.
Tax-saving investments provide an excellent opportunity for individuals to save on their tax liabilities while increasing their savings. With a wide range of investment options available under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, it is important to choose the investment plan that best suits your financial goals and risk appetite."

“I fast for god. I am fasting and I want to fight for the team If I am in the pitch. So thanks god for this moment,” he added.
A couple of weeks ago, the Manchester United winger had deleted his social media accounts to focus on the holy month.
“I deactivated my social media for a month just to focus on Ramadan, it’s a holy month for me and social media is a place where there are bad things to see during fasting. Stop the hatred, there’s nothing wrong with what I did,” he explained his decision.
Scott McTominay put United ahead in the 10th minute before goals from Alexis Mac Allister in the 44th and Mohamed Salah in the second minute of first-half stoppage time gave Liverpool the lead at the break.
After Antony leveled, Harvey Elliott hit the post for Liverpool and Rashford fired wide with only the ‘keeper to beat with the final kick in regulation.
In extra time Elliott restored Liverpool’s lead in the 105th and Rashford leveled for United seven minutes later.
Diallo’s winner killed off Jurgen Klopp’s hopes of winning four trophies before he steps down at the end of the season.
Liverpool has already won the League Cup, is second in the league and through to the quarterfinals of the Europa League."

LS poll dates in: Opposition sees Advantage BJP in Maharashtra’s first five-phase schedule,"In a state where BJP is facing tough challenge, Opposition leaders see a plan to ride on Modi everywhere. Regions where NDA talks toughest will vote last",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/cover_cb725b.jpg?w=640,"Rival parties point out that the BJP and its allies are caught in a bitter seat-sharing tussle here, and it gives them more time now to coordinate when it comes to critical constituencies as well as figure out the best utilisation of their star campaigners. (PTI) Photo)","FOR THE first time, the Lok Sabha elections for its 48 seats will be held across five phases in Maharashtra, spread out between April 19 and May 20. The Opposition believes this elongated schedule is only meant to give the BJP, with its better resources, organisational strength and unflagging election machinery, an advantage.
For example, the fact that Western Maharashtra and North Maharashtra are being kept for polling in the last two phases (May 13, 20). Rival parties point out that the BJP and its allies are caught in a bitter seat-sharing tussle here, and it gives them more time now to coordinate when it comes to critical constituencies as well as figure out the best utilisation of their star campaigners.
Marathwada is one of the regions which will see polls in the most phases – three, for 8 seats altogether. This is being seen as a precautionary step given that this is a battleground of the Shiv Sena and NCP, and may see its different factions collide. The Maratha reservation issue and the resultant OBC backlash have also made Marathwada a potentially volatile territory.
In Vidarbha’s 10 seats in contrast, polls are taking place in two phases, right at the start (April 19, 26).
At the same time, Mumbai voting in the last phase might harm the BJP’s prospects. Party leaders point out that its vote base in the region are North Indian immigrants, forming 20% of the voters, who often head to their native places for summer vacations.
The BJP is not shy of admitting that it wants to cash in on the Modi factor in the maximum seats. Given the gap between phases, his rallies can now be more easily planned across regions. Apart from Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will be holding mega rallies. As one of BJP star campaigners, Maharashtra Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis will cover all the 48 constituencies, plus hold joint rallies with CM Eknath Shinde (Shiv Sena) and Deputy CM Ajit Pawar (NCP).
“The 2024 Lok Sabha polls have only one central issue – those who support Modi vs those who do not. We have realized that Modi’s leadership transcends caste, community and geographical boundaries,” said Fadnavis.
Despite having the second-most constituencies in the country, 48, after Uttar Pradesh’s 80, Maharashtra has in the past seen four-phase Lok Sabha elections at the most. While three phases were the norm from 1962 to 2014, in 2019, the first polls announced with the Narendra Modi government at the Centre, the number of phases were increased to four.
Questioning the decision to hold polls over five phases this time, in an election that remains hard to call, NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar) president Jayant Patil said: “If the BJP is so confident of sweeping the polls, where was the need for five phases? The poll dates are planned so as to suit their campaign. It appears everything is being done to help the BJP.”
Opposition leaders point out that Maharashtra has also seen single-phase polling across 288 Assembly seats, with hardly any major incidents of violence.
Congress state chief Nana Patole said: “Our question is simple. Does Maharashtra need five-phase polls? Whom does it help? After each phase, there is a huge gap, which is clearly intended to support those in power.”
Patole claimed that this showed that the BJP was unsure of its support base. “Therefore, it has to resort to all these tactics.”
Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi president Prakash Ambedkar, who is in talks with the Opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition, said: “In 1985, when I first got into electoral politics, the elections were held in one phase. As far as I recall, a majority of the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections were confined to two phases.”
Now with EVMs, and other technological advances, there was even lesser need to stretch out the election exercise, Ambedkar said, adding that the only reason for five phases appears to be that “the BJP wants to ensure that Modi campaigns in maximum places across Maharashtra”.
Disputing the Opposition’s claims, Maharashtra party president Chandrashekhar Bawankule said, “The Election Commission decides the poll time table, the number of phases and the duration.”
For the EC, law and order would have been paramount, Bawankule said, adding that the number of phases didn’t really concern the BJP. “We are battle ready.”
The Opposition’s claims indicated that, on the other hand, it was already preparing the ground for its defeat. “By finding faults with poll dates, they have exposed their lack of confidence.”
A senior BJP functionary said: “We don’t understand the Opposition’s anger. If five phases give us more time to campaign, it holds true for them too.” Besides, the senior leader added sarcastically, it actually helps the Opposition more as they have a restricted number of star campaigners, such as Uddhav Thackeray, Sharad Pawar and Rahul Gandhi. The BJP, in contrast, has leaders who command support across, the leader said. “The Opposition leaders can use the extra time to make greater inroads. Who has stopped them?”
According to the leader, the EC’s logic seemed purely to be checking possible disturbances. Apart from Marathwada, where Maratha and OBC passions are running high and drought is another concern, the leader said, the Naxal-affected regions of Gadchiroli and Chandrapur have been slotted for voting along with eastern Vidarbha in the first phase, with Western Vidarbha casting its ballot in the second.
Phase-wise voting
April 19: Ramtek, Nagpur, Bhandara-Gondia, Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, all in Eastern Vidarbha.
April 26: Buldhana, Akola, Amravati, Wardha, Yavatmal-Washim in Vidarbha; and Hingoli, Nanded, Parbhani in Marathwada.
May 7: Osmanabad (now Dharashiv), Latur in Marathwada; Raigad, Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg in Konkan; Baramati, Solapur, Madha, Sangli, Satara in Western Maharashtra; and Kolhapur, Hatkanangle.
May 13: Nandurbar, Jalgaon, Raver, Ahmednagar, Shirdi in North Maharashtra; Jalna, Aurangabad (now Sambhajinagar), Beed in Marathwada; and Maval, Shirur, Pune in Western Maharashtra.
May 20: Dhule, Dindori, Nashik in North Maharashtra; and Palghar, Bhiwandi, Kalyan, Thane, Mumbai North, Mumbai North West, Mumbai North East, Mumbai North Central, Mumbai South Central, Mumbai South."

"Lok Sabha poll dates in: Beyond BJP and Congress, this is the lay of the land for regional parties","A dominant DMK, a nervous TMC, a confident BJD, the test on hand for RJD, JD(U), SP, TDP... taking stock across the country",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Untitled-2024-03-17T162030.541.jpeg?w=640,the Election Commission Saturday announced that the Lok Sabha elections will be kicking off on April 19 and will be held in seven phases.

Several, though, have found safety in staying in the middle, while leaning more towards the dominant BJP at the Centre.
A look at how these parties are placed as Lok Sabha elections approach:
While the BJP has been trying to make inroads into Tamil Nadu ever since illness faded Jayalalithaa’s clout and allowed the party to pull the AIADMK to its side, the DMK that came to power in 2021 has held on in the state. In fact, the strong pro-Tamil sentiment in the state is believed to have hurt the AIADMK in its alliance with the BJP, prodding it to split from the party.
However, closer to elections, and with an aggressive new state chief, K Annamalai, in command, the BJP has managed to stay in the narrative. The DMK’s self-goals in the form of statements by its leaders calling for “eradication” of Sanatan Dharma and warning against a strong Centre, have been played up by the BJP as anti-Hindu and pro-separatism, respectively. The BJP believes this will help it strike rich at a time when the Ayodhya Ram Temple fervour has also found resonance in the state. Modi made several trips to Tamil Nadu in the run-up to the polls.
The Congress will hope that its DMK-led alliance holds on – in 2019, the tie-up, also comprising the Left parties, swept Tamil Nadu, winning 38 of the 39 seats. The NDA, then including the AIADMK, won just 1 seat. The BJP drew a blank.
This time, with the AIADMK out, the BJP is in talks with the AIADMK spin-offs led by O Paneerselvam and T T V Dhinakaran.
The Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress has been a powerful player in West Bengal for more than a decade now, but the BJP has made significant inroads. In 2019, it stunned the TMC by winning 18 Lok Sabha seats to the latter’s 22 in the state. However, in the 2021 Assembly elections that followed, the TMC shattered the BJP’s confidence by storming back to power with a huge majority.
What might hurt the TMC this time is the damaging Sandeshkhali episode – reflecting the long rope enjoyed by its strongmen in regions – coming so close to the polls. The Modi government delivered the party another googly by finally implementing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the final hours of its regime. The largest number of CAA beneficiaries are expected to be refugees from Bangladesh settled in Bengal.
The INDIA promise would never have amounted to much in Bengal anyway, given the long and bitter rivalry between the TMC and Left in the state – and it remains debatable how much it would have helped the TMC given the Left and Congress’s decimation in the 2021 Assembly polls.
Mamata’s biggest hope then is retaining the support of the 27-30% Muslim population in the state.
The BJD’s Naveen Patnaik has made a habit of winning elections in Odisha, even putting the BJP in its place for a long time after snapping the alliance with it more than a decade ago. However, as he ages, with no successor in sight, the BJP has cleverly positioned itself as the alternative. Right now, the BJP is doing this by projecting itself as the BJD’s best friend in Delhi – never mind their rivalry in the state – but BJD insiders know from experience that it may not take long for the BJP to turn the tables.
If the talks that are on between the two parties for an alliance do fall into place, there would be no stopping either, come the simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly polls.
In 2019, the BJD won 12 of the 21 Lok Sabha seats in Odisha, the BJP 8 and the Congress one.
In Bihar, the RJD has held on to its core base of Yadavs and Muslims – two large social groups – and still has steam left for a fight, at least come the 2025 Assembly elections. However, with the Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) back in the NDA, the Mahagathbandhan led by the RJD and including the Congress is facing an uphill task in the Lok Sabha polls.
In 2019, the BJP-JD(U)-and Ram Vilas Paswan’s LJP won 39 of the 40 seats in Bihar.
Right now, the hope on the RJD horizon is the shaping up of Tejashwi Yadav as a successor to his ailing father Lalu Prasad. In both, the Congress appears to have steadfast allies.
With exactly the same base as the RJD in Bihar, the Samajwadi Party of Akhilesh Yadav is staying afloat but clearly as a distant second to the BJP. One reason is that unlike Bihar, where Nitish still holds sway on the votes of smaller OBC groups, the BJP has walked away with these in UP. Further, the Yadav population in UP is smaller than in Bihar, and isn’t spread evenly across the state, resulting in pockets of influence for the SP.
In 2019, the SP won 5 seats out of UP’s 80 – in an alliance with the BSP and RLD – with the BJP taking 62. The SP has got a spring in its step though after the 2022 Assembly elections, when it won 111 out of 403 seats on its own against the BJP, establishing itself as the BJP’s only serious rival in the state.
This time, the SP does not have either the BSP as an ally, or the RLD, while its 2022 partner SBSP is with the NDA too.
Like the RJD though, the SP can take heart from the evolution of Akhilesh as its leader after father Mulayam Singh Yadav’s death.
The one politician who has seamlessly traversed the “secular”-Hindutva binary, Nitish Kumar is seen as back on the winning side after re-alliance with the BJP. With a small base of just OBC Kurmis, which he has assiduously expanded to include non-Yadav OBCs and EBCs, Nitish has stayed in power in the rigidly caste-bound state for almost two decades now.
In 2019, his alliance with the BJP ensured an NDA sweep in Bihar. However, the BJP is now clearly the senior partner in the alliance and the JD(U) is seen as a hangers-on. Nitish hence will have a task repeating 2019, when the JD(U) won 17 seats among the NDA’s tally of 39 out of 40.
Plus, having sidelined many senior leaders over the years, Nitish is staring at a vacuum in terms of a successor, putting the fate of his JD(U) under question.
Mayawati’s BSP, a Dalit-centric party that once came to power on its own in UP in 2007, riding on a Sarvajan theme that also attracted Brahmins, has been declining since 2014. Its performances in the 2017 and 2022 UP Assembly elections were poor, and it has steadily lost parts of its support base to the BJP.
In 2019, the BSP won 10 Lok Sabha seats, the most after the BJP in UP, but that was largely due to an alliance with the SP and RLD, getting it Muslim and Jat votes. This time, the party is contesting alone, if contesting at all, with Mayawati a cipher except for sporadic posts on X.
The last five years have not been good for TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu, since his loss to the YSRCP in the 2019 Assembly elections. In the run-up to the coming simultaneous elections, Naidu spent 53 days in jail in the Skill Development Corporation scam, before being released on bail on medical grounds. After that, he pursued the BJP till the party finally agreed to a tie-up with it, along with TDP partner JanaSena Party.
The YSRCP, formed by Jagan Mohan Reddy, after breaking from the Congress, dealt the TDP a stupendous loss in 2019, riding on Jagan’s 3,000-km-long Praja Sankalpa Yatra, covering 125 of the 175 Assembly constituencies. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the YSRCP won 22 seats and the TDP just 3. The BJP and Congress failed to open their account.
Fearing anti-incumbency, the YSRCP has shuffled candidates, but also invited defections.
The Congress hopes the Telangana win will rub off in Andhra, but it is not likely to translate into much.
The raison d’etre of the BRS, originally known as the Telangana Rashtra Samithi, led by K Chandrashekar Rao, was the creation of the state of Telangana. This led to its back-to-back Assembly wins in the state, till it lost power in the November 2023 elections. In the Lok Sabha too, it continued its dominance, winning 11 out of 17 Lok Sabha seats in 2014, and nine in 2019.
The last elections, however, saw the BJP make inroads, with 4 seats, ahead of the Congress’s 3 and the AIMIM’s 1. In the recent Assembly polls too, the BJP performed well, doubling vote percentage from 7 to 14.
The BRS, which is dispirited since the Assembly poll loss, doing apparently little to check the trickle out of the party, has to find an agenda beyond Telangana to hold off the BJP. Meanwhile, its leader K Kavitha was arrested on Friday in the Delhi liquor policy case, hours to go for the announcement of the polls.
The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha formed the government in the Assembly elections held towards end-2019, in alliance with the Congress and RJD. That alliance has held, even as CM Hemant Soren had to step down from his post and is now in jail over corruption allegations. With JMM founder and Hemant’s father Shibu Soren ailing, there is no real charismatic leader to pull the party along, though Hemant’s wife Kalpana is projecting herself as that face.
In 2019, the BJP, riding on a Modi wave, swept the Lok Sabha seats in the state – winning 12 of the 14 (BJP 11 and AJSU 1). The JMM-Congress alliance won 2.
Maharashtra politics has been in a state of flux since the Assembly elections in end 2019 left the state without a clear majority. While the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress managed to form a government, BJP-engineered splits – in first the Sena and then the NCP – have helped the national party enjoy power in the state as well as left its two former rivals floundering.
The official factions of both the Sena and NCP are now with the BJP, and the party is hoping that will serve it well. In 2019, the BJP-led NDA won 41 of the state’s 48 seats.
The Congress, a formidable power in its own right in the state once, now is dependent on the Sena and NCP factions with it. In one of the few states where INDIA was meant to have smooth sailing, the seat talks are still stuck.
The AAP’s free power and water schemes, and focus on education and health, earned it power in Delhi followed by Punjab. However, the Lok Sabha has been a different story, with the party never winning a seat in Delhi and reduced to zero in 2019 from four in 2014 in Punjab.
In Delhi, the AAP this time is banking on its alliance with the Congress – which is wobbly at best, given the opposition to it in-house; and incongruous at worst, given their rivalry in Punjab.
With the sword of Kejriwal’s likely arrest hanging on its head, and with several of its top leaders behind bars, the AAP is probably more hopeful of its chances in Punjab than Delhi, where the BJP swept all the seven Lok Sabha seats in 2019.
Even as late as 2004, the CPI(M) along with Left allies, had enough heft to challenge its partner UPA’s Indo-US nuclear deal. While its footprint was shrinking then too, it was a force in three states – Bengal, Kerala and Tripura.
However, now it has been swept out of the picture in Bengal and Tripura by the TMC and BJP, leaving the CPI(M) a force essentially only in Kerala. Its unprecedented back-to-back Assembly wins in the state, though, are seen as more a Pinarayi Vijayan achievement, than of the central leadership.
Conversely, while Vijayan wants no truck with the Congress – its main rival in Kerala – the CPI(M)’s clout nationally rests essentially on the Congress high command’s partiality towards it.
As Rahul Gandhi contests from Wayanad in Kerala again, the main factor behind the Congress-led UDF’s 2019 sweep of 19 of 20 Lok Sabha seats in Kerala, the CPI(M) remains bristling in Kerala. Its national leaders, however, remain hopeful of making some inpact with their INDIA partnership."
How the United States plans to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza,"The US solution to deal with hunger in Gaza, as Israel continues to pummel the Palestinian enclave while blocking overland access to almost all aid, is to deliver supplies using a floating dock and pier.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/2024-03-17T191842Z_215475339_RC2MN6AZUB5Y_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-AID.jpg?w=640,"Humanitarian aid falls through the sky towards the Gaza Strip after being dropped from an aircraft, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, as seen from Israel's border with Gaza, in southern Israel, March 17, 2024. (REUTERS/Amir Cohen)","US Army ships have sailed from Virginia with equipment to build a floating pier on the Gaza coast to deliver humanitarian aid to the enclave, Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj Gen Pat Ryder said on March 12.
“We expect the pier to be fully operational in approximately 60 days which will be able to facilitate the delivery of about 2 million meals per day,” Ryder said.
The project to build the floating pier — the American solution to deal with hunger and an impending famine in Gaza as Israel continues to pummel the Palestinian enclave while blocking overland access to almost all aid — is officially known as Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore (JLOTS).
Former Indian Navy officer Cmde Srikant Kesnur (Retd) told The Indian Express that JLOTS capabilities are used to transport cargo by sea when one or more ports cannot be operated or are not available for loading or unloading.
“Usually, JLOTS is part of a military campaign or exercise — either you want to fight in another country or you want to deliver aid and don’t have an operational port to embark or disembark. In most cases, it is assumed that loading (of cargo) would be well executed, but the unloading will happen over the shore,” Cmde Kesnur said.
Such operations usually involve joint operations by the forces — while the navy transports the goods and provides protection, the army or other agencies are involved in building the ‘last mile’ bridge, delivery, etc.
The floating pier in Gaza will be built with no “US boots on the ground”. The US will take the help of the private company Fogbow, which is run by former military and intelligence officials, according to a report by the BBC.
The project will consist of two main components, a floating dock and an approximately 548-metre-long pier with a causeway, the US Department of Defense has said.
The floating dock will be a platform built with pieces of steel, which will be delivered to the spot by a roll on, roll off ship — which is essentially a cargo ship with a platform to load and unload heavy cargo.
While the pier will be attached to the shore, the dock could be located up to a kilometre from the coast. The dock is required so that ships carrying aid don’t have to come close to the shore where they may possibly get stuck in shallow water, Maj Gen A V Krishna (Retd), a former officer of the Indian Army, told The Indian Express.
“They (the US) will send a ship (to supply the aid) that is (of) 40,000 tonnes. Anything smaller will be a costly business. Such a ship, depending upon the load, will require a depth of more than 4-5 metres, called minimum draft requirement. If it is less, the ship’s keel will get stuck, and it’s very difficult to pull out a ship that is embedded in sand,” Maj Gen Krishna said.
Once the ship unloads the aid on the dock, smaller Logistics Support Vessels (LSVs) will be used to transfer the cargo from the dock to the pier or jetty, which will be a floating structure linking to the shore. A pier can be built in three ways, Maj Gen Krishna said.
One, by using a “ribbon floating” bridge. “Such bridges are used for crossing rivers during wartime. They are strong and can be built within weeks. Each section of the bridge is about 6 metres by 6 metres, and the bridge is folded with the help of torsion bars in the form of a ‘W’. Once the roll on, roll off ship reaches the location, the bridge segments can be pushed into the water and connected end-to-end simultaneously, pushing the bridge towards the shore,” he said. Once the bridge touches the shore, anchors will be dropped on either side of each section to ensure the structure’s stability.
A second way is to use a different type of floating bridge, manufactured by the UK-based company Mabey, Maj Gen Krishna said. The Mabey floating bridge is constructed over a number of pontoons, which are small, flat-bottomed boats with anchors at each end.
On reaching the spot, the roll on, roll off ship will begin to push out the pontoons at right angles to the line of the bridge at the place where the pier is required.
“Say the ship is 500 metres from the shore. You will push out the first pontoon to a distance of 5-10 metres; then the second pontoon to another 5-10 metres. Over these two pontoons, a panel of the bridge will be made. Subsequently, a third pontoon will be pushed out and the previous two will be pushed further towards the shore,” Maj Gen Krishna said.
The process is repeated until the pontoons reach the shore. The bridge on the pontoons is typically a Bailey bridge, a truss bridge that is commonly used in mountainous areas.
The third way is to use a foam floating bridge made of elastomeric materials that are like rubber, but offer better material properties, Maj Gen Krishna said. Such bridges are commonly used in resorts. The US has heavy-duty versions of these bridges, but they are somewhat shaky, he said.
The pier will also have a causeway that will act as its extension. The causeway will ensure that vehicles carrying the aid from the pier to the coast don’t get stuck in boggy sand. Fogbow, the private firm, will move the aid from the shore to distribution points further inland by trucks, the BBC report said.
All floating bridges can take heavy weights such as tanks and cargo. They stay afloat because of buoyancy and density.
The principle of buoyancy states that any fully or partially submerged object experiences an upward force — known as buoyant force — equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.
Objects that are less dense than water stay afloat. That’s because they displace less water and therefore, the buoyant force is more than the gravitational force. Objects that are denser than water sink.
Notably, the ribbon floating bridge is made of steel, which is denser than water. To ensure that it remains afloat, the segments of the bridge are hollow, and contain an adequate quantity of air that makes them less dense than water. The floating dock will also have hollow steel segments.

In most cases, it is assumed that loading (of cargo) would be well executed, but the unloading will happen over the shore,” Cmde Kesnur said.
Such operations usually involve joint operations by the forces — while the navy transports the goods and provides protection, the army or other agencies are involved in building the ‘last mile’ bridge, delivery, etc.
The floating pier in Gaza will be built with no “US boots on the ground”. The US will take the help of the private company Fogbow, which is run by former military and intelligence officials, according to a report by the BBC.
The project will consist of two main components, a floating dock and an approximately 548-metre-long pier with a causeway, the US Department of Defense has said.
The floating dock will be a platform built with pieces of steel, which will be delivered to the spot by a roll on, roll off ship — which is essentially a cargo ship with a platform to load and unload heavy cargo.
While the pier will be attached to the shore, the dock could be located up to a kilometre from the coast. The dock is required so that ships carrying aid don’t have to come close to the shore where they may possibly get stuck in shallow water, Maj Gen A V Krishna (Retd), a former officer of the Indian Army, told The Indian Express.
“They (the US) will send a ship (to supply the aid) that is (of) 40,000 tonnes. Anything smaller will be a costly business. Such a ship, depending upon the load, will require a depth of more than 4-5 metres, called minimum draft requirement. If it is less, the ship’s keel will get stuck, and it’s very difficult to pull out a ship that is embedded in sand,” Maj Gen Krishna said.
Once the ship unloads the aid on the dock, smaller Logistics Support Vessels (LSVs) will be used to transfer the cargo from the dock to the pier or jetty, which will be a floating structure linking to the shore. A pier can be built in three ways, Maj Gen Krishna said.
One, by using a “ribbon floating” bridge. “Such bridges are used for crossing rivers during wartime. They are strong and can be built within weeks. Each section of the bridge is about 6 metres by 6 metres, and the bridge is folded with the help of torsion bars in the form of a ‘W’. Once the roll on, roll off ship reaches the location, the bridge segments can be pushed into the water and connected end-to-end simultaneously, pushing the bridge towards the shore,” he said. Once the bridge touches the shore, anchors will be dropped on either side of each section to ensure the structure’s stability.
A second way is to use a different type of floating bridge, manufactured by the UK-based company Mabey, Maj Gen Krishna said. The Mabey floating bridge is constructed over a number of pontoons, which are small, flat-bottomed boats with anchors at each end.
On reaching the spot, the roll on, roll off ship will begin to push out the pontoons at right angles to the line of the bridge at the place where the pier is required.
“Say the ship is 500 metres from the shore. You will push out the first pontoon to a distance of 5-10 metres; then the second pontoon to another 5-10 metres. Over these two pontoons, a panel of the bridge will be made. Subsequently, a third pontoon will be pushed out and the previous two will be pushed further towards the shore,” Maj Gen Krishna said.
The process is repeated until the pontoons reach the shore. The bridge on the pontoons is typically a Bailey bridge, a truss bridge that is commonly used in mountainous areas.
The third way is to use a foam floating bridge made of elastomeric materials that are like rubber, but offer better material properties, Maj Gen Krishna said. Such bridges are commonly used in resorts. The US has heavy-duty versions of these bridges, but they are somewhat shaky, he said.
The pier will also have a causeway that will act as its extension. The causeway will ensure that vehicles carrying the aid from the pier to the coast don’t get stuck in boggy sand. Fogbow, the private firm, will move the aid from the shore to distribution points further inland by trucks, the BBC report said.
All floating bridges can take heavy weights such as tanks and cargo. They stay afloat because of buoyancy and density.
The principle of buoyancy states that any fully or partially submerged object experiences an upward force — known as buoyant force — equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.
Objects that are less dense than water stay afloat. That’s because they displace less water and therefore, the buoyant force is more than the gravitational force. Objects that are denser than water sink.
Notably, the ribbon floating bridge is made of steel, which is denser than water. To ensure that it remains afloat, the segments of the bridge are hollow, and contain an adequate quantity of air that makes them less dense than water. The floating dock will also have hollow steel segments.

"After Centre alerted states on his fraud in 2019, Donor No 1 Santiago Martin went on electoral bonds buying spree","Centre's message went out in September 2019. EC data shows that within 10 days, the lottery king's Future Gaming & Hotels bought electoral bonds totalling Rs 190 crore",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/santiago-2col.jpg?w=640,Santiago Martin,"The single largest political donor in data released by the Election Commission went on an electoral bond buying spree in 2019 just days after the Union Home Ministry issued a warning to states about its owner, the “lottery king” Santiago Martin, The Indian Express has learnt.
The Centre’s message alerted the eight lottery running states about the alleged “frauds” and “irregularities” linked to Martin’s companies led by the flagship Future Gaming and Hotel Services Pvt Ltd. And told them to stay away.
According to data released by the EC, Future Gaming and Hotels purchased bonds worth Rs 1,300 crore between 2019 and 2024.
The Indian Express has learnt that in a letter dated September 23, 2019, the Home Ministry’s CS (Centre-State) Division specifically mentioned the states of West Bengal, Maharashtra and Punjab where Martin was allegedly operating Future Gaming & Hotels. He ran Big Star G Services Pvt LTd in the other states.
The EC data show that in October 2019, Future Gaming & Hotels started purchasing a series of electoral bonds, totalling Rs 190 crore in just that month alone.
Overall, the EC data show, Rs 12,769 crore worth electoral bonds were cashed by various political parties in the last five years with the BJP cornering 47.46 per cent of the total value followed by TMC at 12.60 per cent and Congress with 11.13 per cent. The data was released by the Election Commission on Thursday following a Supreme Court directive.
The Ministry of Home Affairs’ warning to states about Martin noted that it had received complaints with “serious allegations” against Martin and his lottery firms. They included:
* Martin was residing in Kolkata, had offices in all neighbouring states and was “illegally” selling lotteries in states like West Bengal where the business was prohibited — and that no GST was being deposited in the state.
* He was printing an unspecified number of tickets from printing presses without the knowledge of the state government.
* He was involved in many cases of fraud, being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and had “unaccounted income of more than 1,000 crores towards manipulation of prize winning tickets”.
* He had committed various irregularities in Kerala which were brought to the notice of the MHA by the state. Subsequently, the MHA banned Martin’s Sikkim State Lottery in Kerala.
* The lottery tickets were not serially numbered and were sold by binding a particular number in bundles, thus violating the Lotteries (Regulation) Rules of 2010.
The MHA also asked the states to individually submit information on Martin’s lottery business on an urgent basis.
The Indian Express had earlier reported that the Enforcement Directorate had begun a money laundering probe against Future Gaming in early 2019. By July that year, it had attached assets worth over Rs 250 crore belonging to the company. On April 2, 2022, the ED attached movable assets worth Rs 409.92 crore in the case.
On April 7, five days after the attachment of these assets, Future Gaming bought Rs 100 crore in electoral bonds.

Satwik and Chirag’s rivals Alfian-Ardianto are in All England men’s doubles finals. Is this start of grand Indonesian comeback before Paris Olympics?,"Indonesia is filled with such shooting stars - briefly dazzling, before vamoozing, never to be seen again. The enduring charm is in the fact that when they go missing, they are missed.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Fajar-Alfian-and-Muhammad-Rian-Ardianto.jpg?w=640,Indonesia's Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto shake hands with Indonesia's Mohammad Ahsan and Hendra Setiawan after winning the men's doubles final in All England Open Badminton Championships in 2023 (Reuters),"The Indonesian doubles dominance had gone missing until this week at All England. Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto have resurfaced making semis at Birmingham, just in time to announce their intent to be in contention for the Olympics. But it’s been a curious absence for the Indonesian pairings in tournaments since October.
Hendra Setiawan and Mohammed Ahsan would probably just smile and wave it off if Satwiksairaj Rankireddy actually got down to gushing about them, to their face in his inimitable way. So just as well that Satwik and Chirag Shetty chose to bow deep and complete an awkwardly rushed but genuinely emotional namaskar at the net, after beating their idols in the first round of the All England.
The ‘Daddies’ might still turn up in Birmingham next year, you never know. But the Indian heirs apparent to the greatness throne that the Indonesians once sat on, had wordlessly conveyed their respect and adoration to the legends should it be the last year they play.
Called Daddies because the thrice World champions continued to stay competitive – they even made the last two All E finals – well into their late 30s, the duo are respected unequivocally and universally. Setiawan famously denied the Chinese their home Olympics gold at the Beijing 2008 final with Markis Kido. But along with Ahsan deep into his second innings, the Indonesians have never left the perch of excellence. Though it’s not in the number of titles that evokes everyone’s respect; it’s their calm, classical, cerebral game coupled with no airs.
Deeply invested in the construction of every point, exploring changes in pace and variety in angles, Setiawan-Ahsan’s is not a game of slam-bang hitting at frenzied speed, tippling with power. They played the flat, fast parallels alright, at times, but they oozed serene skills like none other. They don’t talk very much and despite the insane shotmaking – as good as Taufik Hidayat’s in singles – have never been linked solely to style. Unfazed, understated, and undeterred, the duo have played countless finals, breaking down impetuous shotmaking of opponents. 2024 though might be their last season.
With the retirement of Marcus Fernaldi Gideon on his 33rd birthday, one-half of the energetic ‘Minions’ also bows out, leaving a blur-shaped hole in sizzling international doubles. With Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo, he formed one of the most exciting pairings on the circuit as the short-statured duo scaled the tallest of heights, in every arena they played. They lit up 25 tournament finals in a short span, and though they never medalled at the World Championships or Olympics jaw-droppingly, their blitzing game with short snappy returns, ridonculous net skills, and bumblebee movements, made them World No 1s for long.
Both were taunted as kids for being too tiny in Indonesia and told they wouldn’t succeed. Both put in insane hard work to build up scorching-paced games and racquet skills that left opponents disoriented, and scrambling in vain. While Sukamuljo at 28 might still carry on, Indonesia’s iconic decade-definers will never be seen together again on the pro-tour, where they dwarfed the biggest singles names in popularity.
Indonesian men’s doubles badminton had four pairs in the world’s Top 10 till two All England’s ago. But their predominance seems to have disappeared almost overnight, with titles vanishing as well. Muhammad Shohibul Fikri and Bagas Maulana came out of nowhere to win a splendid All England two editions ago. Alfian and Ardianto did the same in 2023, even occupying the top spot in the world rankings too briefly. But their success hasn’t been consistent enough as they take their time to match the Daddies or Minions.
The conventional back court-front court pair of Leo Rolly Carnando and Daniel Marthin have the game and the potential to get consistent in the Top 5 in coming years. But the steady stream of title contenders, that Indonesia was known for and their golden age of merry marauding, can be said to be over.
With their diminishing dominance, the circuit is a tad quieter of rippling laughter, more intense with taut aspirations, and a shade duller – shorn of magical wrist skills and the giddy flat, fast exchanges. Chinese Liang Wei Keng-Wang Chang tend to play that style and smile plenty, but the mirthful joie de vivre of instinctive repartee of the shuttle isn’t the same. The Daddies and Minions won often but never looked like reeling under the tyranny of winning. Excellence came naturally to them.
The Koreans play extremely technical badminton, and the Japanese abhor errors, but stick to predictable albeit disciplined patterns. Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik are a creative pair, but they are bogged down by medal pressures that Malaysians pile on them incessantly. Indonesian champion pairings of the past trailed in deciders and lost their fair share of matches, but there was always a hint of a last-moment heist, the whiff of a turnaround in the mad quick exchanges, where nerves didn’t meddle with high-skilled badminton.
Greater the pressure, mightier the shot-making in the crunch. Spectators would be on the edge of their seats, but the Indonesian pairings showed ice-cold veins, as badminton flowed effortlessly, and spectators stayed captivated, results notwithstanding.
Perhaps as the Olympics draw closer, FajRi and Bakri (as their current two top pairings are nicknamed) might start striking a semblance of consistency. But nothing can match the dazzle-and-disappearance of the gloriously named Yeremia Erich Yotje Yacob Rambitan and Pramudya Kusumawardana, who turned up to win the Badminton Asia Championships last May and the SEA Games. In between the two titles, Rambitan nastily tore an ACL, while Kusumawardana loyally and patiently waited for him to recover. But results on the circuit dawdled, and Kusumawardana hopped over to Australia to study psychology, quitting on badminton.

"Gujarat Hardlook | How Surat’s Suman Schools are powering dreams, changing lives of low-income groups","The Surat Municipal Corporation was the first civic body to introduce Suman High Schools in multiple mediums to arrest dropout rates among underprivileged children. Twenty-five years after their establishment, the schools continue to stay relevant and play a key role, especially in a city with more than 40 per cent migrant population.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/suman-schools.jpg?w=640,Suman High Schools programme was introduced in 1999 to provide quality secondary education to the low-income group in Surat city with nominal fees. (Express File Photo),"Twenty-year-old Jagruti Patil’s father passed away 13 years ago. Her mother who works as a house help to run the family. She ensures that the family’s monetary circumstances do not affect her children’s education. Living up to her mother’s expectations, Jagruti topped Suman High School in Pandesara area of Surat last year in the Class 12 boards scoring 95.7 per cent and is now doing her B.Com from D. B. Bhana College at Vesu in Surat.
“My younger brother is now in Class 10 at Suman High School No 6 in Pandesara. My maternal uncle who runs an auto garage also stays close by and helps us when needed. I was not expecting such high marks, but my hard work and dedication paid off. I want to become an IAS or an IPS officer. My mother told me to fully concentrate on studies and not think about earning money,” Jagruti says. She starts her mornings by getting her brother ready for school and doing the household chores after which she sits to study.
Similarly, CA aspirant Siddhi Tarsariya has high aspirations. She is the youngest among the three children of Bharatbhai who works at a diamond factory in Surat. He earns around Rs 15,000 per month, while his wife and elder daughter supplement the family income by doing embellishments on sarees from home. The eldest is a son who works as a collection agent at a private bank. The family lets Siddhi to solely focus on her studies.
“My entire education was from the municipal school starting from Class I. Currently, I am taking coaching for Chartered Accountancy and have taken a scholarship for tuition fees from CA Ravi Chhawchharia. I have completed the foundation course in December 2023 and am now doing my intermediate course after which the CA Final will be the last hurdle,” says Siddhi who is also an external student of B.Com at Amroli college.
The 20-year-old plans to teach Chartered Accountancy after clearing the final.
First-year MBBS student Mayur Katariya is the son of diamond factory worker Nagjibhai — the sole breadwinner of the family of two children. Nearly two weeks ago, Mayur was invited by his alma mater, Suman High School at Punagam, to felicitate him and thus, inspire Class 12 students. “Due to my family’s poor financial condition, my parents got me admitted to the municipal school. Later, through our community leader, I got admission at a private school from where I did my Class 9 to Class 12. I gave scholarship exams at private schools and secured a seat,” he said.
Mayur scored 95 per cent and 81 per cent in Class 10 and Class 12 respectively, and cleared the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) scoring 620 to secure an MBBS admission at Government Medical College in Surat.
Mayur’s sister is a second-year commerce student, while his mother supplements the family income by decorating sarees.
Apart from their studious nature that powers their dreams, Jagruti, Siddhi and Mayur have another common link — all are alumni of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC)-run Suman (Surat Maha Nagar) schools.
Why Suman schools
The civic body introduced the Suman High Schools programme back in 1999 “to provide quality secondary education to the low-income group of the city with nominal fees”.
According to Suman Schools Administrator Dharmesh Patel, the schools were started to reduce “dropout rates” as a large number of students who passed out from the municipal board schools after class 8 struggled to get admission in class 9 self-financed or grant-in-aid schools. Thus, many would discontinue their studies. “In Suman schools, we give admission only to municipal school students. We have 23 schools with 182 classes for class 9 and 10 students and 17 schools with 57 classes for class 11 and 12 students,” Dharmesh said.
Back in 1999, classes were offered only in Gujarati medium. However, 25 years later, Marathi, Hindi, Odia, Urdu and English medium schools have also been established to keep up with the demands of the city’s high migrant population. Nearly 40 per cent are migrants in Surat’s population of 70 lakh.
According to Dharmesh, the school board has added Marathi medium schools on demand. “So, we started new classes for 11 and 12 Science streams. The school authorities are also planning to start Class 12 Science in Gujarati medium in the next academic session in 2025,” Dharmesh Patel said.
He added that there is a shortage of schools and classrooms. “On our request, SMC has added four new schools whose foundation stone was virtually laid by PM Narendra Modi during his recent visit to Navsari on February 22, 2024. The project will be finished by June 2025 and we will get 40 more classrooms,” he said.
For the longest time after it was established, Suman schools were only focused on secondary school education. That changed with the Covid-induced hardships.
In 2021, at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, when many parents were shifting their children from private schools to government-run schools, SMC former standing committee chairman Paresh Patel came up with the idea of launching classes 11 and 12 for Science and Commerce streams in Suman schools.
Currently a BJP councillor, Paresh Patel told The Indian Express that SMC sees education as a fundamental right of each and every child. “We noticed that students belonging to the low-income class were not enrolling themselves for secondary education after primary education. There might be many issues affecting their decision. Some may have to join private schools. Others may have to join grant-in-aid schools that are far from their residences. The dropout ratio increased as a result,” he said.
In 2022, Suman schools were started for Class 11 in general stream in the Gujarati, Marathi and Hindi mediums, and Science Stream in Marathi medium.
The first batch of students appeared in the Class 12 board exams in March 2023.
Last year, 10 students from various Suman high schools secured an A1 grade in Class 12 in the commerce stream. Four of these 10 were from the lower middle-class.
While 92 per cent commerce students cleared the exam, the pass percentage in the science stream was 75 per cent. The pass percentage of Class 10 board exam was 75 per cent last year.
“I was a bright student, and the Municipal teachers paid extra attention to me. They believed that I would do something great in future. In the municipal school, I learnt how to build a good character along with studies. The municipal schools are neat, clean and tidy, and even the teachers ensure that students come in neat and tidy uniforms,” Mayur Katariya said.
While education is absolutely free of cost for girls, boys are charged Rs 200 per year till class 10. For classes 11 and 12, the boys have to pay a one-time fee of Rs 1,000.
Suman vs Municipal board schools
SMC was the first civic body in Gujarat to run higher secondary schools. The civic body runs two school boards — the Municipal school board for students from classes 1 to 8, and the Suman High School board that runs secondary and higher secondary sections. The two boards are separate and function independently under the civic body. Different officials are deputed for the administration of both boards.
While Suman schools came into existence only 25 years ago, the Surat Municipal School Board was established in 1925 and runs 327 schools from classes 1-8 with a headcount of 1.71 lakh students across seven mediums — Gujarati, Hindi, Telugu, Marathi, Urdu, English and Odia.
Overall, 13,477 students (6,184 boys and 7,293 girls) from classes 9 to 12 study across 23 Suman schools in Gujarati, Marathi, Hindi, Odia, Urdu and English mediums. These include 2,730 students (1,116 boys and 1,614 girls) in Class 11 and Class 12 Commerce stream in Gujarati, Marathi and Hindi mediums across 49 classes. In the science stream, there are two classes with 103 students (43 boys and 60 girls).
This year, 5,338 students of the SMC-run higher secondary schools are sitting for class 10 and 12 board exams that commenced on March 11.
The state government annually sets aside Rs 900 crore — 80 per cent as grants — to run municipal schools till Class 8. For Suman schools, however, the funds are generated from various schemes of the state government and the budget increases around 10 per cent annually. The budget for the current year is at Rs 50 crore.

Twenty-five years after their establishment, the schools continue to stay relevant and play a key role, especially in a city with more than 40 per cent migrant population.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/suman-schools.jpg?w=640,Suman High Schools programme was introduced in 1999 to provide quality secondary education to the low-income group in Surat city with nominal fees. (Express File Photo),"Twenty-year-old Jagruti Patil’s father passed away 13 years ago. Her mother who works as a house help to run the family. She ensures that the family’s monetary circumstances do not affect her children’s education. Living up to her mother’s expectations, Jagruti topped Suman High School in Pandesara area of Surat last year in the Class 12 boards scoring 95.7 per cent and is now doing her B.Com from D. B. Bhana College at Vesu in Surat.
“My younger brother is now in Class 10 at Suman High School No 6 in Pandesara. My maternal uncle who runs an auto garage also stays close by and helps us when needed. I was not expecting such high marks, but my hard work and dedication paid off. I want to become an IAS or an IPS officer. My mother told me to fully concentrate on studies and not think about earning money,” Jagruti says. She starts her mornings by getting her brother ready for school and doing the household chores after which she sits to study.
Similarly, CA aspirant Siddhi Tarsariya has high aspirations. She is the youngest among the three children of Bharatbhai who works at a diamond factory in Surat. He earns around Rs 15,000 per month, while his wife and elder daughter supplement the family income by doing embellishments on sarees from home. The eldest is a son who works as a collection agent at a private bank. The family lets Siddhi to solely focus on her studies.
“My entire education was from the municipal school starting from Class I. Currently, I am taking coaching for Chartered Accountancy and have taken a scholarship for tuition fees from CA Ravi Chhawchharia. I have completed the foundation course in December 2023 and am now doing my intermediate course after which the CA Final will be the last hurdle,” says Siddhi who is also an external student of B.Com at Amroli college.

First-year MBBS student Mayur Katariya is the son of diamond factory worker Nagjibhai — the sole breadwinner of the family of two children. Nearly two weeks ago, Mayur was invited by his alma mater, Suman High School at Punagam, to felicitate him and thus, inspire Class 12 students. “Due to my family’s poor financial condition, my parents got me admitted to the municipal school. Later, through our community leader, I got admission at a private school from where I did my Class 9 to Class 12. I gave scholarship exams at private schools and secured a seat,” he said.
Mayur scored 95 per cent and 81 per cent in Class 10 and Class 12 respectively, and cleared the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) scoring 620 to secure an MBBS admission at Government Medical College in Surat.
Mayur’s sister is a second-year commerce student, while his mother supplements the family income by decorating sarees.
Apart from their studious nature that powers their dreams, Jagruti, Siddhi and Mayur have another common link — all are alumni of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC)-run Suman (Surat Maha Nagar) schools.
Why Suman schools
The civic body introduced the Suman High Schools programme back in 1999 “to provide quality secondary education to the low-income group of the city with nominal fees”.
According to Suman Schools Administrator Dharmesh Patel, the schools were started to reduce “dropout rates” as a large number of students who passed out from the municipal board schools after class 8 struggled to get admission in class 9 self-financed or grant-in-aid schools. Thus, many would discontinue their studies. “In Suman schools, we give admission only to municipal school students. We have 23 schools with 182 classes for class 9 and 10 students and 17 schools with 57 classes for class 11 and 12 students,” Dharmesh said.
Back in 1999, classes were offered only in Gujarati medium. However, 25 years later, Marathi, Hindi, Odia, Urdu and English medium schools have also been established to keep up with the demands of the city’s high migrant population. Nearly 40 per cent are migrants in Surat’s population of 70 lakh.
According to Dharmesh, the school board has added Marathi medium schools on demand. “So, we started new classes for 11 and 12 Science streams. The school authorities are also planning to start Class 12 Science in Gujarati medium in the next academic session in 2025,” Dharmesh Patel said.
He added that there is a shortage of schools and classrooms. “On our request, SMC has added four new schools whose foundation stone was virtually laid by PM Narendra Modi during his recent visit to Navsari on February 22, 2024. The project will be finished by June 2025 and we will get 40 more classrooms,” he said.
For the longest time after it was established, Suman schools were only focused on secondary school education. That changed with the Covid-induced hardships.
In 2021, at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, when many parents were shifting their children from private schools to government-run schools, SMC former standing committee chairman Paresh Patel came up with the idea of launching classes 11 and 12 for Science and Commerce streams in Suman schools.
Currently a BJP councillor, Paresh Patel told The Indian Express that SMC sees education as a fundamental right of each and every child. “We noticed that students belonging to the low-income class were not enrolling themselves for secondary education after primary education. There might be many issues affecting their decision. Some may have to join private schools. Others may have to join grant-in-aid schools that are far from their residences. The dropout ratio increased as a result,” he said.
In 2022, Suman schools were started for Class 11 in general stream in the Gujarati, Marathi and Hindi mediums, and Science Stream in Marathi medium.
The first batch of students appeared in the Class 12 board exams in March 2023.
Last year, 10 students from various Suman high schools secured an A1 grade in Class 12 in the commerce stream. Four of these 10 were from the lower middle-class.
While 92 per cent commerce students cleared the exam, the pass percentage in the science stream was 75 per cent. The pass percentage of Class 10 board exam was 75 per cent last year.
“I was a bright student, and the Municipal teachers paid extra attention to me. They believed that I would do something great in future. In the municipal school, I learnt how to build a good character along with studies. The municipal schools are neat, clean and tidy, and even the teachers ensure that students come in neat and tidy uniforms,” Mayur Katariya said.
While education is absolutely free of cost for girls, boys are charged Rs 200 per year till class 10. For classes 11 and 12, the boys have to pay a one-time fee of Rs 1,000.

"The MacBook Air (M3) is ready for the ‘AI era’, but what you do with it matters the most","The 13-inch MacBook Air M3 is fantastic for web browsing, working on documents, entertainment and light photo and video editing.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/apple-macbook-air-m3-review.jpg?w=640,The new MacBook Air M3 is made for everyday computing. (Image credit: Anuj Bhatia/Indian Express),"Apple has added to all the confusion around AI PCs by pitching the new M3 MacBook Air as the “World’s Best Consumer Laptop for AI.” Yep, another computer with “AI” sprinkled on top of the messaging. But the truth is, the full picture will be revealed only when the company reveals its Gen AI strategy later this year, as CEO Tim Cook has already indicated. That means this notebook is now more of an AI-ready computer that may not give you exactly the true scale at which Apple sees how generative artificial intelligence will be embedded across its operating system or services.
So, should you get the new M3 MacBook Air just on the premise of it being a computer almost ready for the prime-time AI era, or do you want to upgrade to a Mac as a replacement for an old notebook that seems outdated both in tech and performance? I know, it won’t be an easy choice to make, but I hope my review will simplify your buying decision and help you choose the right Mac notebook for your needs. Here’s my take on the new M3 MacBook Air, which I have had for a week.
On an average day, I use my MacBook Air more than my iPhone. It’s the one device I use for everything from banking, creative work, entertainment, to online shopping. I have made a clear distinction between the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. And because of the MacBook Air’s design and smaller footprint, I use the device more often than I should be using a laptop on a regular day. During a workday that starts early in the morning, I find and distribute copies for my team members, and then I open my mail and respond to pending emails. Once I have breakfast, I open the Notes app on the Mac and write down the tasks I need to achieve. With copies from team members in my mail, I open Google Docs and edit them. I also use the Calendar app on the Mac to look for my appointments of the day. From there, my day actually starts, which involves a lot of writing and attending calls. Before I go to bed, I always listen to one or two podcasts or watch a documentary. At home, I use other devices a lot, like my iPhone for accessing WhatsApp or LinkedIn.
However, my Mac remains a central part of my digital life. In fact, at weekends, I test new apps or play games on the Mac. This has become a regular thing in the past few months.
Its size was the biggest draw for me, and I’m sure it’s the same for most people. I travel a lot – it’s the demand of my job, which makes it even more critical that I choose the lightest notebook possible that also meets my needs. Coming from a 16-inch MacBook Pro M3 Max (review) (which I still use and have no plans to give up anytime soon), the MacBook Air felt like a much different device. Just walking and travelling with the MacBook Air made so much difference. It is damned light, and you forget it’s there in your bag. With the MacBook Pro, which is not only heavier but also has a larger footprint overall, I struggle a lot with working on it on the plane. However, the MacBook Air allows me to write and edit copies on the plane or watch a movie while waiting to catch a flight in the airport lounge.
So just think about it. I can now take the MacBook Air on extended trips and still have the power of macOS and processing chops while also carrying my Nintendo Switch and Boom 3 portable speaker in the backpack. It’s a reminder that the reduced weight and smaller footprint of a laptop make a huge change in the life of a journalist like mine who is always on the go. More than the weight, I’d say the fact that I can grab the MacBook Air and work anywhere, in a cafe, take it to launch events, or in a park and write a piece with utmost silence gives a fresh perspective on using a computer. I am not a desk person, and now you know why I like the MacBook Air so much.
The MacBook Air is a gorgeous laptop, and I’m pretty sure people will notice it. A lot of my colleagues asked me about the new MBA when I brought it to the office. This notebook has a character of its own. Gone is the wedge-like design that made the MacBook Air a lot thicker toward the hinge of the screen. Instead, the M3 MacBook Air (as also seen on the M2 MacBook Air) has a wedgeless design. The M3 version has more rounded edges when the screen lid is closed. The design language is introduced to give continuity across all new Apple products. On my lap, on the couch, or on the desk, the device feels right.
The starlight colour variant, the one I got for review, is not only visually appealing but is also less of a fingerprint magnet. I had zero issues with the MacBook Air. The design, fit and finish, and build quality are impressive. I am glad that Apple maintains the same design ethos across all of its products, no matter if the device commands an extremely high price or falls into the entry-level category.
The M3 MacBook Air has two Thunderbolt Ports and MagSafe on the left, and a headphone jack on the laptop’s right side. The port situation is perfect for new-age average consumers who use cloud-based services like Google Drive to save their data. I know a lot of people don’t use SD cards or HDMI ports, and Apple was right about eliminating all of the extra ports and making room for a notebook that looks and feels lightweight. However, those who regularly use a USB-A port (in fact, people still use pen drives a lot in India) may be disappointed to find no USB-A port on the MacBook Air.
The M3 MacBook Air finally supports two external displays with the laptop closed. Previously, M1 and M2 Airs could only use one, and the lid had to be open. So, this may seem like a small change, but I feel it’s a significant boost, and users will appreciate the add-on, especially those who work in a hybrid setup.
Despite a compact footprint, the M3 MacBook Air still has the same Magic Keyboard, Touch ID and a set of full-height function keys as the 16-inch MacBook Pro M3 Max. The keyboard is so much joy to type on; the keys are responsive, allowing for smooth and accurate typing.
The 1080p webcam is way better than that on older MacBooks and matches the quality of the MacBook Pro. Additionally, the 13.6-inch display is an ideal size for daily writing, reading the e-paper of the Indian Express, watching movies, and even playing games. I feel the 13.6-inch display is the right size for tasks I’d like to do on a laptop, such as taking notes or spending hours on Pinterest. For those who want a bigger display, I think the 15-inch MacBook Air may be a better option. However, if you are a pro-consumer, I think the 14-inch MacBook Pro is something you should check out as it comes with a brighter MiniLED panel and 120Hz ProMotion display.
Ideally, the M3 MacBook Air will be fine for most consumers; its display is bright and vibrant and comes with 500 nits of brightness and improved P3 colour over the Intel MacBook Airs. Even the speaker quality on the MacBook Air is fantastic, given how thin this laptop is. Sure, they are not at the same level as my 16-inch MacBook Pro, which has six built-in speakers. Of course, the MacBook Pro speakers are loud and expansive as if the sound is coming from a HomePod mini. But for the size, the MacBook Air has excellent sound quality. Anyway, I use my AirPods most of the time when I am working or chilling.
I had been testing the top-end version of the 13.6-inch M3 MacBook Air for a week. It comes with an 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 512GB of SSD, and 16GB of RAM. One of the things that pleasantly surprised me about the M3 MacBook Air is the speed improvement. The 16GB of RAM, instead of 8GB, makes a difference. However, I would like to add that the change will be most visible if you are coming from an Intel-powered MacBook Air or M1 MBA. While 8GB RAM will be sufficient for most tasks people do on a computer, I personally opt for the 16GB RAM, given I need a machine that lasts for at least 5 years at a minimum. Anyway, the M3 is an excellent upgrade over the M1 and previous Intel versions, but the performance jump from M2 isn’t drastic except for a few changes. My M3 MacBook Air handled heavy tasks like multitasking with multiple tabs open or performing light video editing.
In my day-to-day use, I never felt the laptop was taxed. But again, it all depends on the tasks you perform on a computer. If you’re an Adobe Creative Cloud user, get an M3 MacBook Air. The apps run like a dream on a MacBook Air M3. Frankly, if you are someone who is an independent writer but also records and edits podcasts, I would easily recommend getting the M3 MacBook Air. This is a laptop for people who are in creative fields. Period.
Because of the excellent CPU performance, including graphical upgrades, the M3 MacBook Air supports hardware-accelerated mesh shading and ray tracing, which offers more accurate lighting, reflections, and shadows in video games. Games optimised for the Mac, such as Death Stranding: Director’s Cut, which I played, ran flawlessly on the M3 MacBook Air, though the 16-inch MacBook Pro M3 Max is better equipped to handle AAA games. I couldn’t believe I played a AAA game on a Mac, which I previously couldn’t. It’s still early days as far as gaming on Mac is concerned, but I am glad that Apple has finally acknowledged the gaming potential on a Mac after years of silence.
Perhaps for me, a make-or-break moment for any laptop is the battery life. I am okay to settle for one less USB-C port but can’t compromise on the battery life. Thankfully, the MacBook Air M3 has the best battery life I’ve tested on a lightweight laptop in years. Although Apple claims the MacBook Air M3 laptop can last up to 18 hours, I got 15 hours and 12 minutes of juice. The only laptop that lasts even longer is my 16-inch MacBook Pro M3 Max, but that laptop is way heavier.
When Apple pitches its M3 MacBook Air as an AI laptop, one needs to take it seriously. AI is everywhere in your phone, apps, and now laptop. I still don’t fully understand what is meant by “AI” in a notebook, especially when Apple has been using AI and machine learning in its devices for many years. I think AI could define the Mac in the months to come and become a meaningful part of the experience. As of now, the aspect of AI that truly redefines the Mac is not there. I am sure Apple wants to run Generative AI right on the Mac rather than on servers, which is how ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot get all the power. I tried FreeChat, a Mac-based chatbot which shows the potential of On-device Gen AI but the question lingers on how well Apple optimises Gen AI and morphs it into the core Mac experience.
I have fallen in love with the M3 MacBook Air, not only because of the promise of future AI but due to its sheer portability. Its fanless design, excellent performance, long battery life, and sexy design all complete the pieces of the puzzle for a complete notebook. And Apple delivers on that front, even if one has to pay a price for it. But no one can take credit away from Apple for making the experience smooth. By experience, I don’t just mean macOS, the software that powers the Mac, but also little things like the Apple migration assistant that seamlessly transfers apps and settings from an older Mac to a new Mac.

I have fallen in love with the M3 MacBook Air, not only because of the promise of future AI but due to its sheer portability. Its fanless design, excellent performance, long battery life, and sexy design all complete the pieces of the puzzle for a complete notebook. And Apple delivers on that front, even if one has to pay a price for it. But no one can take credit away from Apple for making the experience smooth. By experience, I don’t just mean macOS, the software that powers the Mac, but also little things like the Apple migration assistant that seamlessly transfers apps and settings from an older Mac to a new Mac.

Climate change is no joke. But we can laugh about it,"Even as many struggle to understand climate change or connect it to what is happening around them, stand-up comedians are now tackling the subject head-on and some believe this might actually help people engage with the subject more easily.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/IMG_9230.jpg?w=640,"Comedians at the 'Laughs Per Minute -- Breathless edition', a show organised by Deadant and Asar on March 10. (Express Photo)","“Doesn’t a bitter pill go down easier when sugar-coated?”, comedian and screenwriter Neeti Palta says. She was among the 20 comedians who performed at the Shri Ram Centre of Performing Arts in Delhi on March 10 for a show titled ‘Breathless’ that focused on the poor air quality in the National Capital.
The punchlines ranged from poking fun at 999 AQI (air quality index) – for the scale cannot measure a poorer air quality level – to the blame game between Delhi, Punjab and Haryana. “They must get together and clear the air,” one comedian remarked.
Joking about the environment can be tricky. One may run the risk of joining a cohort of climate change deniers or those who have little understanding of the matter. For instance, amid a severe cold wave in the USA in January 2019, its then-president Donald Trump tweeted, “Wouldn’t be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now!” His comment did not go down well with environmental activists, who have time and again emphasised the urgent need to combat climate change.
The message has always been that we must act now to save the planet because the alternative is death, destruction, and despair. With a constant sense of impending doom and having lost countless lives already, can we laugh about climate change?

Comedian Daahab Chishti tells indianexpress.com, “Pain brings out the best part of the joke.” During the show, she remarked, “You think smoking is injurious to health? We live in hazardous!” Chishti says, laughing, “I was personally connected to the cause… In fact, my lungs were personally connected to it.”
In 2021, Chishti was severely impacted by Covid-19, leaving a part of her lungs unable to function normally. Starting from the end of September or early October till the time of peak winter, Chishti says she experiences difficulty in breathing.
She is not alone. Siddharth Sudhakar, another comedian, says he starts his day by checking the AQI as he is constantly worried about his ageing mother. “So, when DeadAnt and Asar approached me for the cause I could not even imagine saying no. It was an opportunity for me to spread the word, help in my own little way.” While DeadAnt is a media organisation that focuses on comedy in India, Asar works on social and environmental issues.
Comedian Rupali Tyagi, with her joke on being unable to kiss her husband shortly after hearing news about dying polar bears, shed light on the rise of eco-anxiety among the young.
When asked about her writing process for such a serious premise, Tyagi says, “I try to feel what the characters facing the issue might feel and how those characters will find humour as an escape.”
Humour allows one to “speak the truth, raise awareness, address an issue in a more palatable way,” Palta adds.
Souparno Banerjee, senior director at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), says his organisation works similarly to make climate change easier to understand. “I feel the problem is that people still do not connect what is happening in their day-to-day lives to climate change, or other kinds of environmental degradation with climate change. For instance, extreme weather events. Not many people actually connect it to the fact that climate is undergoing negative changes.”
A 2022 study by Yale University, ‘Climate Change in the Indian Mind’, echoes this thought. Notably, researchers found that 35 per cent of Indians surveyed said they had “never heard” of global warming. In contrast, only nine per cent said they know “a lot” about global warming. The report, however, adds that the “lack of awareness of the issue” does not mean that these individuals “have not observed changes in local weather and climate patterns.”
“This suggests that many people in India may have observed changes in their local climate and weather patterns without understanding that these changes are related to the broader issue of global climate change,” the report said.
Banerjee says these linkages need to be talked about more. He welcomes the comic take on climate change, adding, “We are desperately in a situation where there is real and present danger, and we need to be talking about it to any kind of medium that we can get access to.”
When asked if one would run the risk of trivialising the issue, Banerjee reasons, “Air pollution is a fairly serious issue. And there are clear linkages that we find between air pollution and climate change. It is a very welcome change where you have stand-up comics actually talking about it and making light of it. I am sure the audience which is listening does not think about it like that. I do not think there is any question of trivialising.”
Clinical psychologist and head of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences, at Fortis Healthcare, Dr Kamna Chhibber, says that while humour may not necessarily make people pay more attention, “when something is presented in a lighter manner they may be more willing to engage with it and may not want to ignore it or distance themselves from it. As a result, they may be more receptive towards it, as it is more palatable.”
Tyagi adds, “When the right intent, effort and craft come together, the results can be powerful.”"

From empowering Simi Garewal during a nude scene to bringing Sharmila Tagore’s shoot to a halt with his charm: Why Shashi Kapoor was adored by his co-stars,"On Shashi Kapoor's 86th birth anniversary, we peer into the life of one of Hindi cinema's most dashing actors through the eyes of his female co-stars, who celebrated his chivalry, kindness and honesty a little more than his striking looks.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/simi.jpg?w=640,Shashi Kapoor and Simi Garewal in a still from their 1972 film Siddhartha. (Pic: Express Archive),"On Koffee With Karan Season 8, Neetu Kapoor admitted to having a crush on her uncle Shashi Kapoor. Though her revelation was met with a shocking reaction from Karan Johar, Shashi’s female fans would probably be thinking, ‘Join the club!’ Despite being the least flamboyant of all the Kapoors during his era, Shashi Kapoor was widely regarded as one of the most handsome men in the film industry. However, his charm went beyond his looks. What truly endeared him to his female fans was his simplicity, honesty, family-oriented persona and his respectful demeanor towards his co-stars.
Shashi Kapoor’s female co-stars have often spoken about his supportive nature on sets, recalling instances that reflect his gentlemanly qualities. Let’s delve into some of these recollections:
When Shashi Kapoor gave confidence to Simi Garewal to shoot a partially nude scene
In Aseem Chhabra’s book “Shashi Kapoor: The Householder, The Star,” Simi Garewal recounted an instance from their 1972 film Siddhartha, where Shashi made her feel comfortable during a nude scene. Simi was nervous before the scene, but Shashi’s encouraging words gave her the confidence to proceed with grace and confidence.
“I can’t tell you how nervous I was before these scenes,” she said. “I finally wore a body-stocking from the waist down, but when I had to go topless, I was stricken. I couldn’t look up and just lowered my eyes. Shashi sensed what I was going through and said to me, ‘Don’t be shy, Simi. You are beautiful.’ Buoyed by his words, I found the courage to go through it all with confidence,” she said.
Zeenat Aman found Shashi Kapoor ‘devastatingly handsome’
Zeenat Aman’s admiration for Shashi Kapoor’s good looks began in her school days, long before she could have imagined sharing the screen with him. In an earlier interview, Zeenat reminisced about the time Shashi visited her school accompanied by his wife, Jennifer Kendal, to perform a play. Zeenat and her school friends were captivated by Shashi’s devastatingly handsome appearance. Remembering the same, she said, “I did some of my most enjoyable and unforgettable films with him. But before that, I remember when I was studying at the St Joseph’s Convent. Shashiji came with his wife to perform a play in our school. All of us schoolgirls were in a swoon. He was devastatingly handsome.”
Years later Zeenat and Shashi starred in one of the most-talked-about and controversial films of Hindi cinema – Satyam Shivam Sundaram. During the interaction, Zeenat recalled how despite being a mega star, Shashi was shy to take off his shirt while shooting for a song because he wasn’t confident about his physique. She said, “I remember Shashiji was shy about taking off his shirt under the waterfall in Satyam Shivam Sundaram when were shooting the song Yashomati maiya. He didn’t think he had the physique to pull it off.” Zeenat lauded Shashi for always being ‘gracious, warm, courteous and gentlemanly’ toward her during their time shooting together.
When Sharmila Tagore couldn’t concentrate when Shashi Kapoor was on set
While Zeenat Aman’s first meeting with Shashi Kapoor was in her school, veteran actor Sharmila Tagore met the actor for the first time on the sets of her film Kashmir Ki Kali, where she was shooting alongside Shashi’s brother, Shammi Kapoor. Despite Shammi’s own charm and charisma, Sharmila found herself unable to concentrate on her scenes due to her overwhelming attraction to Shashi’s good looks.
Recalling the experience, Sharmila said, “We were shooting the song ‘Isharon isharon mein’ with Shashi’s brother Shammi. I couldn’t concentrate on my romantic poses with Shammi. The director Shakti Samanta had to ask Shashi to leave.” She added, “I still remember how handsome he was. My God! He was the most handsome man I had seen.” Shashi Kapoor and Sharmila Tagore went on to star in many iconic films including Waqt, Aa Gale Lag Jaa, Aamne- Saamne, Suhana Safar and more.
He would pick up luggage of any lady he came across: Raakhee Gulzar
Raakhee Gulzar’s admiration for Shashi Kapoor extended beyond his on-screen persona. During the interview, Raakhee recounted instances where Shashi displayed acts of chivalry and kindness uncommon among Hindi cinema’s superstars.
She said, “I’ve never met a more cultured man. If we were on the airport he would pick up the vanity case and other luggage of any lady he came across. If there was a crowd at a shooting he would clear it for me to feel comfortable. These qualities I’ve never encountered in any of my heroes.”

On the occasion, her father and legendary Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan took a trip down memory lane and recalled the day he and his wife, Jaya Bachchan, brought Shweta to their Mumbai home “Prateeksha” for the first time. He also revealed how the family celebrated the special day.
“A day filled with the love of family and the greetings and the hilarity of the ‘progress reports’ 🤣,” Bachchan wrote on his blog. “Birthdays galore… Shweta, the first born, and Nikhil her husband.. within a day of each other and the bringing in of the GOLDEN age – 50 years…!”
“At Prateeksha, she was brought to the home, our first home of our own, when she was barely 2, and Abhishek a few months old… and today to see them celebrate the day in the same home on the same table and surroundings… LIFE IS A WONDER… Children and grandchildren all together,” he noted. Amitabh has bequeathed the bungalow, Prateeksha, to his daughter last year. The bungalow is valued at approximately Rs 50.63 crore and holds a special place for the Bachchans. It was here that he lived there with his parents, Harivansh Rai Bachchan and Teji Bachchan. He owns two other bungalows in Mumbai – his current residence, Jalsa, and Janak.
“Family is the greatest bond… of love togetherness and the joys of each other… may it ever be in lasting… and the family at the GOJ…? they are supreme,” Bachchan added while sharing a few photos of him greeting his fans outside his home.

The new merchandise includes a variety of apparel, with prices ranging from Rs 16,000 to Rs 99,000.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/srk_6bf4fc.jpg?w=640,Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan dropped the new collection of his clothing brand. SRK was seen posing with Aryan and Suhana. (Pic: SRK/X),"On Sunday, Shah Rukh Khan unveiled a new poster featuring his son Aryan Khan and daughter Suhana Khan, marking the release of the latest collection from Aryan’s clothing brand, DyavolX. The new line, titled ‘Triple Threat. X-2,’ offers a range of apparel including hoodies, T-shirts, crop tops, and denim jackets, with prices ranging from Rs 16,000 to Rs 99,000.
In his announcement on social media, Shah Rukh Khan shared the poster and wrote, “X-2. Live now. Get yours only on http://dyavolx.com. Limited quantities. Global shipping.” The poster has SRK with Suhana Khan and Aryan Khan.

— Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) March 17, 2024
Among the highlights of the limited edition collection is the denim jacket, priced at Rs 99,000, marking Aryan’s first foray into denim design. The hoodies are priced at Rs 41,000 and Rs 40,000 respectively, while the crop tops, including the one worn by Suhana in the poster, are priced at Rs 16,000. The T-shirts showcased by Shah Rukh Khan and Aryan Khan in the poster are priced at Rs 21,500 each. Additionally, the latest collection introduces cargo pants priced at Rs 35,000.
Despite these seemingly high prices, they are comparatively lower than those of Aryan’s debut collection in 2023, which featured a piece worth Rs 2 lakh. The debut collection saw rapid sales, with many items, including Shah Rukh Khan’s signature hoodie adorned with an ‘X,’ selling out within hours, priced at Rs 2,00,555.
During his earlier interview with GQ, Aryan Khan shared how his father Shah Rukh’s role extends beyond being the face of the brand as he brings a little ‘sanity and maturity’ to his ‘edgy’ it . He said, “Some things that would take me some time to wrap my head around were seamless for him. Our brand is edgy, so he’s around to keep some semblance of sanity and respectability, otherwise, there could be too much madness. Because we are an age-agnostic brand, I think we have an interesting balance: I have a more contemporary way of thinking; my father brings a dose of maturity into it. Having perspectives from both ends allows the brand to align with our collective vision as well, which is to appeal and cater to everyone, from a 10-year-old to a 70-year-old.”

Among the highlights of the limited edition collection is the denim jacket, priced at Rs 99,000, marking Aryan’s first foray into denim design. The hoodies are priced at Rs 41,000 and Rs 40,000 respectively, while the crop tops, including the one worn by Suhana in the poster, are priced at Rs 16,000. The T-shirts showcased by Shah Rukh Khan and Aryan Khan in the poster are priced at Rs 21,500 each. Additionally, the latest collection introduces cargo pants priced at Rs 35,000.
Despite these seemingly high prices, they are comparatively lower than those of Aryan’s debut collection in 2023, which featured a piece worth Rs 2 lakh. The debut collection saw rapid sales, with many items, including Shah Rukh Khan’s signature hoodie adorned with an ‘X,’ selling out within hours, priced at Rs 2,00,555.
During his earlier interview with GQ, Aryan Khan shared how his father Shah Rukh’s role extends beyond being the face of the brand as he brings a little ‘sanity and maturity’ to his ‘edgy’ it . He said, “Some things that would take me some time to wrap my head around were seamless for him. Our brand is edgy, so he’s around to keep some semblance of sanity and respectability, otherwise, there could be too much madness. Because we are an age-agnostic brand, I think we have an interesting balance: I have a more contemporary way of thinking; my father brings a dose of maturity into it. Having perspectives from both ends allows the brand to align with our collective vision as well, which is to appeal and cater to everyone, from a 10-year-old to a 70-year-old.”

She commented, “I’m feeling very poor.”

Dadasaheb showcased his graphic designing company called DesignTemplateio, on the platform asking for an investment of Rs 1 crore for 2.5 percent equity.

Before that, he was a daily wage-earner who was getting paid Rs 80 per day. However, his inclination towards design led him to start this successful enterprise, Designtemplate.io, in 2018.

Yodha box office collection day 3: Sidharth Malhotra’s actioner earns Rs 12.75 cr in opening weekend; faces stiff competition from Shaitaan,"Yodha box office collection day 3: The Sidharth Malhotra actioner's total India nett collection currently stands at Rs 16.85 crore. In spite of generating buzz since its filming commenced in November 2021, Yodha managed to accumulate only Rs 4.1 crore on its opening day.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/yodha-18032024-2.jpg?w=640,"Sidharth Malhotra's action thriller Yodha recorded its highest single-day total so far on Sunday, providing the long-delayed film some respite. (Image: Dharma Productions/Facebook)","Despite hitting the screens at a time when it had no notable competitors, except for Vikas Bahl’s Ajay Devgn-starrer Shaitaan, Sagar Ambre and Pushkar Ojha’s actioner Yodha, featuring Sidharth Malhotra in the lead role, has not managed to deliver outstanding performance since its release on Friday. Nonetheless, Yodha recorded its highest single-day total so far on Sunday, providing the long-delayed film some respite.
In spite of generating buzz since its filming commenced in November 2021, Yodha managed to accumulate only Rs 4.1 crore on its opening day, significantly less than the first-day domestic nett of other top-grossing Hindi films this year such as Fighter (Rs 22.5 crore), Shaitaan (Rs 14.75 crore) and Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya (Rs 6.7 crore).
Nevertheless, Yodha showed improvement over the weekend and ended up earning an India nett collection of Rs 7 crore, as per early estimates by industry tracker Sacnilk, compared to Rs 5.75 crore on Saturday, marking a 21.75 per cent increase.
This brings its total India nett collection to Rs 16.85 crore. However, on Sunday, which marked its 10th day in theatres, Shaitaan earned Rs 9.75 crore, highlighting Yodha’s struggle to compete.
On Sunday, Yodha saw an overall occupancy of 23.29 per cent in the Hindi market. While the morning shows had just 12.74 per cent occupancy, the figure witnessed an upward trend as the day progressed, rising to 24.62 per cent in the afternoon and peaking at 32.57 per cent during the evening shows. The rate, however, witnessed a major dip during the night screenings and stood at 23.22 per cent.
Considering that Fighter, the highest-grossing Indian film of 2024 so far, earned Rs 29 crore on its first Sunday in theatres and Shaitaan and Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya recorded Rs 20.5 crore and Rs 10.75 crore, respectively, Yodha’s performance was underwhelming. It remains to be seen if the actioner will pass the Monday test with flair.
Also starring Raashii Khanna, Disha Patani and Ronit Roy in key roles, Yodha was bankrolled by Dharma Productions and was originally scheduled for release in July 2023 but faced delays. Despite being postponed to December 2023, the film did not hit screens until March 15, 2024.
In her review of Yodha, The Indian Express’ Shubhra Gupta wrote, “Things plummet soon enough as Sidharth Malhotra goes full tilt at the rescue operation that ends with a pacifist note in the heart of our neighbouring country.”

Javed Akhtar blames alcoholism for failed first marriage with Honey Irani: ‘I would become a very nasty man’,Javed Akhtar revealed how his alcohol addiction strained the relationship with his first wife Honey Irani.,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/javed.jpg?w=640,"Javed Akhtar opens up about marriage with his first wife, Honey Irani. (Photo: Archive Photos)","Javed Akhtar recently opened up about his marriage to his first wife Honey Irani, and his battle with alcoholism in an interview. Akhtar and Irani were married for 11 years before they parted ways in 1985. During the interview, Akhtar revealed how his alcohol addiction strained their relationship.
Speaking on Mojo Story, Akhtar advocated for a Uniform Civil Code in India, citing his own adherence to such principles in his personal life. He said, “I am living in uniform civil code. I was married to a lady, after 11 years of marriage we got divorced. According to Muslim personal law, I was only responsible to give her alimony for four months but I didn’t think that. She was my responsibility. It is also her choice whether she wants my support or not, but whenever she wanted and whenever she will, or she may not as she is very self respecting person, but I’m available for help. I walked out of the house with some books and some clothes. That’s all. And now we are best of friends because of this relationship and this understanding.”
Sharing how alcoholism took a toll on his first marriage, he said, “I started drinking at the age of 20-21 and left when I was 42 years old. I could afford a bottle and used to drink almost a bottle every night. It’s very common for Urdu poetics to become big drunkards because they believe that if they are poets and artistes, they should be carefree and you should drink. I think I had those wrong values.”
He added, “On the other side, all the tehzeeb that I learned in Lucknow didn’t allow me to use foul language, so all the bitterness was compressed inside me. But when I used to drink all those barriers will break and I would become a very nasty man and would use foul language. I used to become another person. It was unhealthy, irrational and causing problem to many people. It impacted my marriage with Honey. If I was a sober and responsible person, the story would have been different.”
Javed AKhtar also revealed that his second wife and veteran actor Shabana Azmi ‘somehow managed’ his alcoholism for the first ’10 years of their marriage’. However, at the age of 42, Akhtar himself realised that he might ‘die soon’ if he keeps on drinking the same way.

"‘Anybody who says Aamir Khan is an interfering person, I think they are completely…’: Sneha Desai on writing Kiran Rao’s Laapataa Ladies","Sneha Desai, one of the writers of Kiran Rao's directorial Laapataa Ladies opens up about introducing Manju maai's character in the film and talks about how involved Aamir Khan is when he backs a project.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Snha-Desai-Laapataa-Ladies-Aamir-Khan-Kiran-Rao-Ravi-Kishan.jpg?w=640,"Sneha Desai opens up about working with Aamir Khan, Kiran Rao and Ravi Kishan on Laapataa Ladies. (Photos: Sneha Desai/ Instagram)","The big budget, big screen spectacles scene flipped after Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s 12th Fail, starring Vikrant Massey, released in October last year. People were ready to pay to watch rooted stories. This year one such film released that was backed by Aamir Khan — Laapataa Ladies, directed by his ex-wife Kiran Rao. The film’s writer Sneha Desai has opened up about what went into telling this story, based in the heartland of India, and how the satire gives out a social message in the simplest way without being preachy.
In this interview with indianexpress.com Sneha talks about being mentored by Aamir Khan, reveals that while she wrote the character of Manju maai (played by Chhaya Kadam) it remains Kiran’s “brainchild” and what went behind etching the character of Shyam Manohar (played by Ravi Kishan), a corrupt police officer whose character flip is the film’s highlight.
Laapataa Ladies is Sneha’s debut feature film. She has written hit shows like Pushpa Impossible and Wagle Ki Duniya. Sneha says working with Aamir and Kiran was the kind of “mentoring” she was looking for at this stage of her career.
 
 
A post shared by PK ni PANCHAYAT (@pk_ni_panchayat)
Aamir is often mentioned as an actor who interferes in the project’s writing process. Debunking this ‘myth’, Sneha says, “I had one of the finest working experiences and learning curves of my life with Aamir sir and Kiran ma’am. They are such hands-on producers and extremely down-to-earth and intelligent. They are also very sensitive, they exactly know what they want… what they want to say. They respect your creative freedom and ideas, they are willing to engage in dialogue, they agree to disagree, so it was a very democratic process. Anybody who says that Aamir sir is an interfering person is completely wrong; he is an extremely involved person. He is very passionate about how his production shapes up and is willing to go to any length to give you the kind of production value that you seek as a writer.”
“As a (feature film writer) debutante, the respect I got over there, the kind of grooming that I got at his production house has been spectacular and I wish every debutant writer gets a similar opportunity because it shapes you for life,” she adds.
 
 
A post shared by Sneha Desai (@snehadesaiofficial)
While Laapataa Ladies is being loved for its overall story by critics and the audiences alike, what really stands out is how cross class and relatable the story is and the impact of Manju Maai’s character that, Sneha says, was not even there in the initial story, but was added because the director wanted it.
“It is a wonderful story. It in fact won the second prize at the Cinestaan competition. So, the beats and the grain of the story remained almost the same, there were certain characters that were not etched out like Manju maai. Kiran and I wrote Manju maai’s character, it was not there in the original story,” reveals Sneha.
 
 
A post shared by Chhaya Kadam (@chhaya.kadam.75);
Adding more on how they worked together on fleshing the character, Sneha says, “Manju maai was actually Kiran’s brainchild.

Sneha was involve in the film to make it more “commercial” as she comes from a television background. On how she worked on the story which was more “serious and dramatic” before Kiran chose to direct it. She says, “The story was more serious and dramatic tone, so it was the tone and the tenor that we primarily changed. We wanted it to be entertaining, we wanted it to have a message that was not preachy. We added a lot of humour and satire to the theme. But that is also the prerogative of the screenplay and the dialogue writer because the story basically gives you a flow of the events. So, full marks to Biplab Goswami for creating this beautiful premise from which we could take off so beautifully.”
On how Laapataa Ladies stands so relevant to women of all classes and cultures, Sneha says, “The story spoke so beautifully to us because even though it was set in the heartland of India, it was primarily the story of any woman. You place it in an urban milieu and it would still call out to you, you place it in a dark milieu and it would still call out to you. So, it was basically the universal theme of empowering women, of following your dreams, of finding yourself when you have lost track of your dreams and aspirations that called out to us and we decided that we wanted to say a lot of things through our characters and through this story.”

Shena then also opens up about how she carved Ravi Kishan’s much loved character, the corrupt police officer, Shyam Manohar and the switch that brings the film’s story together.
Shena reveals, “A lot of characters got added in the process. While Ravi Kishan’s role was there in the story, it was definitely not this etched out. Shyam Manohar, not Ravi ji. Shyam Manohar’s role and character became so important that we felt that we needed a person for a cameo in the film. Ravi ji was a prototype when we were casting because we needed someone like Ravi Kishan, so we were like why do we need someone like him when we can ask him to do the role himself. He belongs to that mitti (soil) he belongs to the heartland, he knows the walk and the talk of the people so we’ll, that he looks so beautifully camouflaged in that entire landscape that when the twist happens you don’t see it coming.”
Opening up about why the writers wanted Shyam Manohar’s character to switch, Sneha says, “He looks like a letch of a police officer, he is greedy and just waiting to pounce on the meat and just at the right time he comes across with such a beautiful twist. Of course I don’t want to give much away of the twist because it will be a spoiler, but that’s the kind of casting that we were looking at and I should really give credit to Divyanidhi Sharma as he really helped shape Shyam Manohar’s character in the script and on the screen.”

"‘Anybody who says Aamir Khan is an interfering person, I think they are completely…’: Sneha Desai on writing Kiran Rao’s Laapataa Ladies","Sneha Desai, one of the writers of Kiran Rao's directorial Laapataa Ladies opens up about introducing Manju maai's character in the film and talks about how involved Aamir Khan is when he backs a project.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Snha-Desai-Laapataa-Ladies-Aamir-Khan-Kiran-Rao-Ravi-Kishan.jpg?w=640,"Sneha Desai opens up about working with Aamir Khan, Kiran Rao and Ravi Kishan on Laapataa Ladies. (Photos: Sneha Desai/ Instagram)","The big budget, big screen spectacles scene flipped after Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s 12th Fail, starring Vikrant Massey, released in October last year. People were ready to pay to watch rooted stories. This year one such film released that was backed by Aamir Khan — Laapataa Ladies, directed by his ex-wife Kiran Rao. The film’s writer Sneha Desai has opened up about what went into telling this story, based in the heartland of India, and how the satire gives out a social message in the simplest way without being preachy.
In this interview with indianexpress.com Sneha talks about being mentored by Aamir Khan, reveals that while she wrote the character of Manju maai (played by Chhaya Kadam) it remains Kiran’s “brainchild” and what went behind etching the character of Shyam Manohar (played by Ravi Kishan), a corrupt police officer whose character flip is the film’s highlight.
Laapataa Ladies is Sneha’s debut feature film. She has written hit shows like Pushpa Impossible and Wagle Ki Duniya. Sneha says working with Aamir and Kiran was the kind of “mentoring” she was looking for at this stage of her career.

Aamir is often mentioned as an actor who interferes in the project’s writing process. Debunking this ‘myth’, Sneha says, “I had one of the finest working experiences and learning curves of my life with Aamir sir and Kiran ma’am. They are such hands-on producers and extremely down-to-earth and intelligent. They are also very sensitive, they exactly know what they want… what they want to say. They respect your creative freedom and ideas, they are willing to engage in dialogue, they agree to disagree, so it was a very democratic process. Anybody who says that Aamir sir is an interfering person is completely wrong; he is an extremely involved person. He is very passionate about how his production shapes up and is willing to go to any length to give you the kind of production value that you seek as a writer.”
“As a (feature film writer) debutante, the respect I got over there, the kind of grooming that I got at his production house has been spectacular and I wish every debutant writer gets a similar opportunity because it shapes you for life,” she adds.

While Laapataa Ladies is being loved for its overall story by critics and the audiences alike, what really stands out is how cross class and relatable the story is and the impact of Manju Maai’s character that, Sneha says, was not even there in the initial story, but was added because the director wanted it.
“It is a wonderful story. It in fact won the second prize at the Cinestaan competition. So, the beats and the grain of the story remained almost the same, there were certain characters that were not etched out like Manju maai. Kiran and I wrote Manju maai’s character, it was not there in the original story,” reveals Sneha.

Murder Mubarak review: Sara Ali Khan stars in a delightful whodunit,"Murder Mubarak review: This is the closest any film has come to re-creating Anuja Chauhan’s universe, very few can do the insider-outsider divide with such acuteness, both sharp and warm.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/murder.jpg?w=640,Murder Mubarak review: The film is currently streaming on Netflix.,"Finally, a film which gets the delightful tonal qualities of Anuja Chauhan’s novels, so Delhi, so quirky, and in this one specifically where she trains her gaze on class through that most classist of Delhi places — the club where you wait forever to become a member because those who are there will never leave, unless they are murdered.
ACP Bhavani Singh (Pankaj Tripathi) and his sidekick are hauled in from their roadside chaat stall into the tony environs of the Royal Delhi Club. Does it stand in for the Gymkhana, or Raisina, or Golf, or a combo? You decide. The murder of a hunky gym trainer opens a can of worms which wriggle quite deliciously under the weight of Bhavani’s deceptively benign eye, and his sharp understanding of human nature.
Everyone is a suspect. Rannvijay Singh (Sanjay Kapoor), the broke ex-royal who takes left-overs home under the guise of giving to the poor; Shehnaaz Noorani (Karisma Kapoor), the B-grade heroine of C-grade movies; the always tipsy, wonderfully named Cookie Katoch who sips on tequila-and-beetroot, while sculpting on the side (Dimple Kapadia), the perfectly-attired Roshni Batra (Tisca Chopra) who loves her son to distraction. There are others in the list too, the ones who play Tambola with the battle-like glint in their eyes, when not casting those peepers into everybody else’s business, which includes the plump, sniffly club manager (Deven Bhojani).
‘Aap jaise log nahin samjhenge what this club means to me’. This priceless sentence, uninflected by irony, hurt completely unintended, is Bambi (Sara Ali Khan), the ditsy Todi girl, trailing a string of admirers and a dead husband in her wake, just being Bambi. The ‘log’ refers to ‘people like Bhavani’ who refuses to be put in his place, because he knows exactly who he is, as opposed to the girl opposite him, who proffers kind words to Guppi Ram (Brijendra Kala), the cat-loving old server who’s not quite all there, and breathy kisses to childhood pal-who-could-have-been-more Akash-aka-Kashi Dogra (Vijay Varma).
The ensemble is excellent. Pankaj Tripathi as Bhavani Singh stays Pankaj Tripathi except for a characteristic hmmm, and a habit of adding ‘ji’ to all names, leading to much hilarity: the dead man is ‘Leo ji’, and Bambi becomes, of course, Bambi ji. Good to see Karishma Kapoor back. And for Khan to rediscover the fact that she can play a character. Sanjay Kapoor gets a moving moment. I’m not so sure about Verma because he doesn’t look as smooth as he should, but he’s always so good to watch, so that’s fine. And the murder-mystery, which involves a dash of blackmail and old secrets, does unravel quite well (too bad for those who remember the killer from reading Chauhan’s ‘Club You To Death’): the big reveal is quite a shocker.

The thing that takes away from the film somewhat are its scattered bits. You wish, for example, Bambi’s dead husband was given a bit more to do when he was up and about; there’s an entire chunk revolving around an orphanage, and an abandoned baby, which could have done with a bit more detailing. Your eye doesn’t really settle in as much as it should, but fortunately the plot does have quick recovery loops. And while ‘Murder Mubarak’ is the closest any film has come to re-creating Chauhan’s universe, very few can do the insider-outsider divide with such acuteness, both sharp and warm. Watch it, smile, and then, if you still haven’t, go read.

Bastar The Naxal Story movie review: Watching this is beyond terrible,Bastar The Naxal Story movie review: To expect any kind of nuance from the makers of The Kerala Story would have been a stretch. Bastar is more of the same.,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/bastar.jpg?w=640,"Bastar movie review: Lacking any nuance, this film continues with The Kerala Story's pitch-black narrative","The Kerala Story unit returns, this time to focus on the evils of the ‘Maoists’ who tramp up and down with impunity down their ‘red corridor’, hacking to pieces anyone who dares to claim loyalty to the Indian flag, backed by ‘leftists, media, Bollywood, NGOs’, and a certain university whose name starts with J and ends with U, and is muted sufficiently so that everyone can hear it loud and clear.
Just like in their previous film which used sliding numbers to press their point home, Bastar, The Naxal Story repeats this line: ‘50,000 to 60,000 innocents have been killed since the advent of these Maoists’, fuelled by the Lashkar and LTTE, as well as other global terrorist outfits.
And just to make sure that there’s no confusion in our minds, one such killing takes place in the opening moments of the film. A ‘Naxalite’ leader (Krishna) takes an axe and goes hack, hack, hack, one limb falling after another, blood spraying, till there is nothing left of the body but pieces, while the victim’s wife and daughter are made to watch. I’m finding it hard to write this. Watching this is beyond terrible, but the filmmakers are determined that neither they nor their camera will blink.

To expect any kind of nuance from the makers of The Kerala Story would have been a stretch. Bastar is more of the same. When IPS officer Neerja Madhavan’s (Sharma) thunders that she wants to shoot all ‘these left liberals’, she means everyone of similar persuasion. The film is clear about everyone it wants to paint pitch-black: the sleeveless-blouse sporting journalist (Sen) is a venal Maoist-sympathiser, and along with the smirking female lawyer (Shukla) who fights the case for the ban on Salwa Judum (the organisation created to fight Naxalism at the grass-roots but was disbanded later), whose leader here is played by Kadam.
It’s nobody’s case that there hasn’t been unconscionable violence wrecked by the Maoist outfits in Bastar. But the film is uninterested in delving deeper to find out the root-cause of the Maoist influence in the region: what was the contribution of the state, and other private parties? The killing of the 76 CRPF jawans is a horrific fact, and that is used to propel Madhavan’s tirades against anyone who doesn’t see it the way she does. The victim’s wife (Tiwari) is recruited: how else will she get revenge? Songs in a university amphitheatre in Delhi alternate between revelry in a Maoist camp in Dantewada, or at any rate somewhere in Chhattisgarh: in the film’s universe, the students and hackers are the same.
How did they manage to leave out a mention of the ‘Khan Market gang’? Tsk.

Clap, clap.
Sidharth Malhotra plays Arun Katyal, a crack soldier of the Yodha unit, which has been assembled to make things right whenever they go wrong. And as far as the writers of this film are concerned, if you are in a plane, things are guaranteed to plummet. After a royally muffed-up first round, our hero gets a chance to fix things, and the poor passengers are once again tossed about (the plane goes upside down, gasp), the bad guys are bearded and have Muslim names, the destination is Islamabad, and the plan (double gasp) is to blow up the peace process between, yes, you’ve guess that right, India and Pakistan.
You can accuse me of letting all cats out of the bag, but I can’t keep these jaw-dropping deets of this totally hair-brained enterprise all to myself any longer: I mean, have you seen not just one but two aircrafts with carpets just waiting to pulled aside and a flap raised easily enough for the passengers to go up and down to the hold? No? Thought not.

And then the film offers up a twist by saying see, see, we’re not bigoted; some Pakistanis are good people; it’s only those pesky terrorists who are to blame. The chief baddie gets to intone– ‘agar shaanti aa gayi toh hamaara kya hoga’, or words to that effect—while using bombs to blow up things.
But worry not. Our Yodha, bravely bearing the scars of his failure in professional and personal areas, is at hand. A separation from spouse-cum- top-notch bureaucrat (Raashii Khanna) is a sore to be scratched, even as he goes full tilt at the rescue operation, dealing with a svelte air-hostess (Disha Patani) who is hiding something, and a newbie pilot in the hot-seat, and ends up on a pacifist note right in the heart of our neighbouring nation.
You may or may not emerge unscathed from this cartoonish rigmarole, but our Yodha, fittingly, gets off with the best line in the movie: iss picture ka hero main hoon. Clap, clap.

Kung Fu Panda 4 movie review: It’s easy to lose attention and hard to care,"Kung Fu Panda 4 movie review: Jack Black and Awkwafina are a hoot but Viola Davis is surprisingly ineffective, failing to evoke the irresistible charisma that marks the best of villains.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Kung-Fu-Panda-4.jpg?w=640,"This film, with Jack Black again as Po — perhaps one of the most inspired voice castings ever — gets off on a solid footing.","As we get into the fourth Kung Fu Panda movie, with several TV versions also under Po’s undulating belt, the inevitable has happened: No. 4 is more kung fu than panda.
This film, with Jack Black again as Po — perhaps one of the most inspired voice castings ever — gets off on a solid footing. With so many adventures behind him already, Master Shifu (Hoffman) says it’s time for Po to pass on the baton, a good turn for the film to take.
However, Po is only just leaning into his Dragon Warrior persona, signing autographs, getting portraits done, lending name to his father’s noodle shop etc etc. He doesn’t think he is ready to put his warrior phase aside to mature, as Shifu puts it, into “Spiritual Leader of the Valley of Peace”, dispensing “wisdom and hope”.
What does that even mean, Po grumbles, before being sent off by Shifu to one of those meditation sessions, “seeking the universe for answers”. The problem is that when Po chants “inner peace”, by about the fourth time he has said it, it has morphed into “dinner please”, then “dinner peas”, then “the kind of peas”…
Indian Express Entertainment is now on WhatsApp Channels. Follow us for the latest news, interviews, reviews, photos and more.
You get the drift. So, it is that when the latest threat to the Valley of Peace arrives, in the form of a shape-shifting sorceress called simply the Chameleon (Davis), he drops all that handing over the baton (or in his case the Shaft of Wisdom) pretence, and heads off into this latest adventure.
His companion is a fox of dubious morals but with a lot of chutzpah and moves of her own, Zhen (Awkwafina). He makes a deal, letting her out of prison where she is serving time for a minor misdemeanour, so that she can lead him to the Chameleon.
This time the journey takes Po — along with Zhen, and his worried dads (Bryan Cranston, James Hong) who can’t stay away — to Juniper City. Here mafia lords reign, petty crime thrives, and Chameleon is bewitching them all into submission with her vile, vile ways.
In the many battles that of course result, a lot of them mid-air — either because Po and the rest have leapt there, or fallen off a cliff or fort — it’s easy to lose attention and hard to care, knowing pretty well how the story goes.
Awkwafina is a hoot, as always, with Po’s transformation – which is, at its heart, the ability to weave words into wise proverbs – happening on account of his jostling with her.
But Davis is surprisingly ineffective, failing to evoke the irresistible charisma that marks the best of villains. And that is despite the many impressive forms, of various sizes and various red-carpet-inspired get-ups, she keeps taking.
In fact, Ian Shane, in his brief appearance as Tai Lung, one of the many villains Po has fought in the past who are summoned back “from the Spirit Realm” by Chameleon, strikes fast and strikes rich.
Of the many proverb-isms which Po eventually does come up, the best perhaps is: “How will you kick butt, if you don’t seek out butts to kick?”
And yet, all your kicks can’t come out of butts.

Indian startups on track to raise $8-12 billion this year: Venture capital firm Peak XV,"Speaking at StartUp Mahakumbh, Peak XV Managing Director Rajan Anandan said around USD 20 billion of private capital is lying uninvested and is committed for investment in private firms and startups in India.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Untitled-design-2024-03-18T124415.072.jpg?w=640,,"Indian startups are expected to raise USD 8-12 billion this year, a top official of venture capital firm Peak XV said on Monday, highlighting that the country’s startup ecosystem is the most vibrant in the world.
Speaking at StartUp Mahakumbh, Peak XV Managing Director Rajan Anandan said around USD 20 billion of private capital is lying uninvested and is committed for investment in private firms and startups in India.
Anandan said that the investment run rate in Indian startups before 2021 and 2022, was about USD 8-10 billion, which increased to USD 60 billion in 2021 and 2022 combined.
“Last year, it was USD 7 billion, which people said is low. It could have been zero because basically six years of funding came in two years.This year we are well on track to USD 8-10 or 12 billion. We are going to have an ecosystem which is going to have USD 10-12 billion for few years and it will go at natural pace that it should,” Anandan said.
He said that USD 10 billion or about Rs 80,000 crore funding per year is enough to build the Indian startup ecosystem.
Citing shift in focus of funding in the US to AI and next generation software entities, Anandan said the Indian startup ecosystem is the most vibrant ecosystem in the world.
He said that his firm last year made investments in consumer businesses which are no longer getting funded in the US.
“India today has 20 startups that are being publicly traded. We think that over the next 7-8 years, there will be 100 startups that will go public,” Anandan said.
He indicated that growth in funding is coming back across funding stages.

"China’s economy shows signs of improvement, but property sector still in doldrums","The real estate sector remained sluggish, with investment in real estate falling 9% in January-February compared to the same period a year earlier.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Untitled-design-2024-03-18T110059.258.jpg?w=640,China's industrial output rose 7% from a year earlier in January-February (File Image),"China’s manufacturing and investment improved in the first two months of the year, while weakness in the property sector weighed on the economy, the National Bureau of Statistics said Monday.
The report said industrial output rose 7% from a year earlier in January-February, better than analysts had forecast. Spending on factories and equipment, known as fixed-asset investments, rose 4.2%. The real estate sector remained sluggish, with investment in real estate falling 9% in January-February compared to the same period a year earlier.
The property market is “still in a state of adjustment and transition” but policies outlined at China’s annual legislative session earlier this month will promote “stable and healthy development,” National Bureau of Statistics spokesperson Liu Aihua told reporters.
During the National People’s Congress meetings, China’s leaders pledged to refine property sector policies, including increasing financing to developers and building more affordable housing.
The signs of strength followed various moves by authorities to boost growth. The statistics bureau said retail sales climbed 5.5% and consumer prices rose for the first time since August. The consumer price index was up 0.7% in February after months of falling prices.
“Industrial production was a sizable beat, supported by strong exports in the month, while fixed assets investments on the other hand, were likely supported by a state-driven push early this year,” said Louise Loo of Oxford Economics in a note.
She said consumer spending was “buoyed temporarily” by spending related to the Lunar New Year holidays, the biggest festival of the year, and that without added government spending it would be difficult to keep up strong growth.
Beijing has set an economic growth target of about 5% for 2024, which experts say may be challenging to reach.
“We expect economic momentum to improve further in the near-term given the tailwind from policy stimulus. But this recovery may prove short-lived due to the economy’s underlying structural challenges,” said Zichun Huang, a China economist with Capital Economics.
Huang said that the correction in property construction is “still in its early stages.” The world’s second-largest economy has struggled to bounce back after the COVID-19 pandemic.
China usually releases economic data monthly, but data for the first two months of the year are combined to avoid distortions from the weeklong Lunar New Year holidays, when many businesses and factories are closed.

The report said industrial output rose 7% from a year earlier in January-February, better than analysts had forecast. Spending on factories and equipment, known as fixed-asset investments, rose 4.2%. The real estate sector remained sluggish, with investment in real estate falling 9% in January-February compared to the same period a year earlier.
The property market is “still in a state of adjustment and transition” but policies outlined at China’s annual legislative session earlier this month will promote “stable and healthy development,” National Bureau of Statistics spokesperson Liu Aihua told reporters.

“All the factors are bearish now, with U.S. yields threatening to test new highs in the run up to the Federal Reserve policy decision later this week,” a trader with a state-run bank said.
U.S. bond yields rose in all five trading sessions last week, with the 10-year yield jumping 22 basis points, marking its biggest rise in five months. The yield is hovering around the critical level of 4.30%, a breach of which could lead to more gains.
The rise in yields is fuelled by indications of a robust economy and elevated inflationary pressures, which have led to concerns over the possibility of fewer interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year.
Traders await the Fed policy decision due on Wednesday amid rising uncertainty about whether the U.S. central bank would start rate cuts later than the widely-expected June timeframe, with chances of an updated dot plot showing only two cuts in 2024, instead of the previously expected three.
The odds for a rate cut in June have eased to 58% from 74% last week, according to the CME FedWatch tool.
Meanwhile, Indian states are aiming to raise a record 502.06 billion rupees (about $6 billion) through bonds on Tuesday. The supply comes at a time when many investors are completing their investment targets for the financial year.
“The state debt supply is a shocker and even though long-term investors would absorb, we could see some pressure on yields,” the bond trader said.

(File Photo),"Adani group plans to invest more than Rs 1.2 lakh crore (about USD 14 billion) across its portfolio companies that range from ports to energy, airports, commodities, cement and media in fiscal year starting April 1, as it doubles down on its USD 100 billion investment guidance over the next 7-10 years to grow businesses, sources said.
The projected capital expenditure or capex for 2024-25 (April 2024 to March 2025) fiscal is 40 per cent higher than what the portfolio is estimated to have incurred in FY24.
According to analysts, the portfolio is estimated to have incurred a capex of around USD 10 billion in FY24 that ends on March 31.
Sources said these investments will set the stage for exponential profit growth.
The group had previously guided a USD 100 billion capex over the next 7-10 years. Most of this investment is going to go into group fast growing businesses — renewable, green hydrogen and airports.
As much as 70 per cent of the planned capex will go into its green portfolio — primarily renewable power, green hydrogen, green evacuation. Of the remaining 30 per cent, the majority will be spent towards airports and ports businesses, they said.
In calendar year 2023, the portfolio delivered a USD 9.5 billion EBITDA (up 34.4 per cent year-on-year), while its net debt has reduced by 4 per cent from March 2023 to September 2023 (balance sheet figures are only declared half yearly).
In the December quarter, Adani’s portfolio reported record EBITDA growth of 63.6 per cent, taking its 12-month EBITDA to an all-time high of USD 9.5 billion (Rs 78,823 crore) in 2023.
Increasing cash flows from fast growing profits have set the stage for mega-scale investments, sources said.
Its net debt to EBITDA at the end of September was 2.5x, which is expected to decline by the end of FY24, sources said.
In a media statement released in February, the group said increasing cash flows from strong growth and robust credit profile has set the stage for unrivalled ‘Green Investment’.
A school drop-out, group chairman Gautam Adani started out as a commodities trader and rose to become Asia’s richest person with an empire spanning across ports, power generation, airports, mining, renewables, gas, data centres, media and cement.
Today, Adani Group is the world’s second largest solar power company, it is the largest airport operator with 25 per cent of passenger traffic and 40 per cent of air cargo, the largest ports and logistics company with 30 per cent of national market share, largest integrated energy player, and the country’s second largest cement manufacturer.
India’s largest infrastructure conglomerate with showcase projects like Navi Mumbai Airport, Ganga Expressway, world’s largest renewable park at Khavda in Gujarat and Mundra Port has committed a USD 100 billion investment over the next 7-10 years. This investment will play a pivotal role in transforming India’s energy and transportation landscape.
Sources said with strong emphasis on green energy transition, it will be allocating more than 70 per cent of this USD 100 billion to its green businesses including renewable power, green hydrogen, and green evacuation transmission lines.
The conglomerate is building the world’s largest renewable park at Khavda, Gujarat, spanning over 530 square kilometers – an area five times the size of the city of Paris.
A large portion of total investments is earmarked for expansion and development of its fast-growing airports business and ports business, they said.
With a portfolio boasting eight airports including the upcoming Navi Mumbai airport and 14 domestic ports, Adani wants to further solidify its presence in these sectors.

"Reliance on oil imports rises in April-February, likely to hit fresh full-year high in FY24","Total production of petroleum products from domestic crude oil was 26.1 million tonnes in April-February, which means that the extent of India’s self-sufficiency in crude oil was just 12.3 per cent, down from 12.8 per cent in the corresponding period of the last financial year.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/oil-import-demand.jpg?w=640,Total production of petroleum products from domestic crude oil was 26.1 million tonnes in April-February. (File Photo),"Growing demand for fuel and other petroleum products amid stagnant domestic crude oil output resulted in India’s reliance on imported crude increasing to nearly 88 per cent in April-February, indicating that oil import dependency for the full financial year 2023-24 (FY24) could breach the all-time-high FY23 levels.
As per latest data released by the oil ministry’s Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell (PPAC), the country’s oil import dependency was 87.7 per cent in the 11 months to February, up from 87.2 per cent in the corresponding period FY23. For full FY23, reliance on imported oil was 87.4 per cent. According to industry insiders, like in the last financial year, import dependency in crude oil for the entire FY24 could be a tad higher than the April-February level.
Given India’s rapidly growing energy demand, reliance on oil imports has been rising continuously over the past few years, except for FY21, when demand was suppressed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reliance on imported crude to meet domestic demand stood at 85.5 per cent in FY22, 84.4 per cent in FY21, 85 per cent in FY20, and 83.8 per cent in FY19.
The government wants to reduce India’s extreme reliance on imported crude oil but sluggish domestic oil output in the face of incessantly growing demand for petroleum products has been the biggest roadblock. In 2015, the government had set a target to reduce reliance on oil imports to 67 per cent by 2022 from 77 per cent in FY14, but the dependency has only grown since. Heavy reliance on imported crude oil makes the Indian economy vulnerable to global oil price volatility, apart from having a bearing on the country’s foreign trade deficit, foreign exchange reserves, rupee’s exchange rate, and inflation.
Cutting costly oil imports is also a fundamental objective of the government’s push for electric mobility, biofuels, and other alternative fuels for transportation as well as industries. Over the past few years, the government has also intensified efforts to raise domestic crude oil output by making exploration and production contracts more lucrative and opening vast acreages for hydrocarbon exploration. While there has been a pick-up in electric mobility adoption and blending of biofuels with conventional fuels, it is not enough to offset petroleum demand growth.
The calculation of the extent of import reliance is based on the domestic consumption of petroleum products and excludes petroleum product exports as those volumes do not represent India’s demand. With a refining capacity of a little over 250 million tonnes per annum, India—the world’s third-largest consumer of crude oil and also one of its top importers—is a net exporter of petroleum products.
India’s domestic consumption of petroleum products in April-February rose over 5 per cent year-on-year to 212.2 million tonnes, underscoring robust demand, particularly for transportation fuels petrol and diesel. However, domestic crude oil production for the year was nearly flat at 26.9 million tonnes. Crude oil imports in the first 11 months of FY24 rose 0.4 per cent year-on-year to 212.6 million tonnes. Additionally, petroleum product imports increased to 43.8 million tonnes from 40.2 million tonnes a year ago. Petroleum product exports in April-February rose 4.2 per cent to 57.3 million tonnes.
Total production of petroleum products from domestic crude oil was 26.1 million tonnes in April-February, which means that the extent of India’s self-sufficiency in crude oil was just 12.3 per cent, down from 12.8 per cent in the corresponding period of the last financial year. In FY23, consumption of petroleum products sourced from indigenous crude oil was 25.8 million tonnes, while total domestic consumption was 201.8 million tonnes.

"FPIs invest over Rs 50,000 crore in equity, debt in March","According to NSDL data, FPIs bought stocks worth Rs 40,710 crore during the month and invested Rs 10,383 crore in the debt market",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/FPI_bfec4f.jpg?w=640,FPIs have been changing their strategy in response to the changes in the bond yields in the United States. (File Photo),"Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) pumped Rs 50,471 crore into the Indian stock and debt markets in March so far despite the high volatility in the stock markets.
According to NSDL data, FPIs bought stocks worth Rs 40,710 crore during the month and invested Rs 10,383 crore in the debt market. They pulled out Rs 857 crore from the debt-VRR category and invested Rs 235 crore in hybrid.
However, as the FPI stock investment includes the BAT decision to sell stocks worth over Rs 16,000 crore which were bought by FPIs, the net investment figure is not a true indicator of the FPI activity.
FPIs were big sellers in January and modest buyers in February. “But in March they have turned big buyers. But this figure includes some bulk deals executed through the stock exchanges and, therefore, is not a true indicator of FPI activity. However, the rising trend of FPI investment continues,” said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.
An important feature of FPI investment for many months now has been its erratic nature. FPIs have been changing their strategy in response to the changes in the bond yields in the US. “Therefore, now that US bond yields have again spiked up in response to stubborn inflation, FPIs may again turn sellers in some of the days, going forward,” he said.
An important trend in the market in March is the weakness in the mid and small caps and the resilience in large caps. This persuaded FPIs to reduce selling in large caps and even buying in limited quantities in sectors like banking, telecom and automobiles, analysts said.
Small and mid-cap stocks fell last week following the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI’s) caution against excessive speculation in these stocks.
Meanwhile, the SEBI has exempted certain FPIs from the additional disclosure framework.
The Sebi Board on Friday approved a proposal to exempt additional disclosure requirements for FPIs having more than 50 per cent of their India equity AUM in a single corporate group, in case the concentrated holdings of the FPIs are in a listed company with no identified promoter, if the certain conditions are met.
In a circular in August 2023, Sebi had asked select FPIs to provide granular details regarding their beneficial ownerships, economic interest and control up to the level of all natural persons.

"FPIs invest over Rs 50,000 crore in equity, debt in March","According to NSDL data, FPIs bought stocks worth Rs 40,710 crore during the month and invested Rs 10,383 crore in the debt market",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/FPI_bfec4f.jpg?w=640,FPIs have been changing their strategy in response to the changes in the bond yields in the United States. (File Photo),"Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) pumped Rs 50,471 crore into the Indian stock and debt markets in March so far despite the high volatility in the stock markets.
According to NSDL data, FPIs bought stocks worth Rs 40,710 crore during the month and invested Rs 10,383 crore in the debt market. They pulled out Rs 857 crore from the debt-VRR category and invested Rs 235 crore in hybrid.
However, as the FPI stock investment includes the BAT decision to sell stocks worth over Rs 16,000 crore which were bought by FPIs, the net investment figure is not a true indicator of the FPI activity.
FPIs were big sellers in January and modest buyers in February. “But in March they have turned big buyers. But this figure includes some bulk deals executed through the stock exchanges and, therefore, is not a true indicator of FPI activity. However, the rising trend of FPI investment continues,” said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.
An important feature of FPI investment for many months now has been its erratic nature. FPIs have been changing their strategy in response to the changes in the bond yields in the US. “Therefore, now that US bond yields have again spiked up in response to stubborn inflation, FPIs may again turn sellers in some of the days, going forward,” he said.
An important trend in the market in March is the weakness in the mid and small caps and the resilience in large caps. This persuaded FPIs to reduce selling in large caps and even buying in limited quantities in sectors like banking, telecom and automobiles, analysts said.
Small and mid-cap stocks fell last week following the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI’s) caution against excessive speculation in these stocks.
Meanwhile, the SEBI has exempted certain FPIs from the additional disclosure framework.
The Sebi Board on Friday approved a proposal to exempt additional disclosure requirements for FPIs having more than 50 per cent of their India equity AUM in a single corporate group, in case the concentrated holdings of the FPIs are in a listed company with no identified promoter, if the certain conditions are met.
In a circular in August 2023, Sebi had asked select FPIs to provide granular details regarding their beneficial ownerships, economic interest and control up to the level of all natural persons. These were FPIs, who held more than 50 percent of their Indian equity Assets Under Management (AUM) in a single Indian corporate group and those that individually or along with an investor group held more than Rs 25,000 crore of equity AUM in Indian markets.

Why Kerala and the Centre are in a dispute over state borrowing limits at the SC,"Before the SC began hearing the case in February 2024, Kerala CM Vijayan had staged a protest at Jantar Mantar alongside other CMs from Opposition-ruled states, calling the Centre’s actions “politically motivated…against non-BJP-run states”.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Kerala-protest-1600.jpeg?w=640,"Sitaram Yechury, Pinarayi Vijayan, D. Raja, Farooq Abdullah and other leaders at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi, during a protest against the Central Government on February 8, 2024. (Express photo: Abhinav Saha)","For the better part of the past year, the Kerala government has claimed that the central government’s fiscal policies have driven the state towards a financial crisis. In December, the state government filed a suit against the Centre at the Supreme Court and claimed that “if damage is not prevented, the Plaintiff (Kerala) State, with its meagre resources, will not be able to recover from this for decades”, as reported by The Indian Express.
Before the court began hearing the case in earnest in February 2024, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan staged a protest at Jantar Mantar in the national capital alongside other CMs from Opposition-ruled states, including Arvind Kejriwal (Delhi) and Bhagwant Mann (Punjab). At the protest, Vijayan called the Centre’s actions “politically motivated…against non-BJP-run states”.
The 15th Finance Commission set the Net Borrowing Ceiling for states at 3% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) for the 2023-24 financial year. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman clarified in December that this would come up to Rs 32,442 crore for Kerala in the 2023-24 financial year. Kerala, meanwhile, claims that the Centre cut its borrowing limit in May and August of last year, whittling the states’ borrowing limit down to Rs. 15,390 crore.
The Finance Commission, on its part, designated Kerala as a “highly debt stressed” state that often resorts to borrowing from the central government in order to pay for day-to-day expenses such as salaries and pensions. The commission also noted that Kerala spent the second-highest percentage of its total revenue expenditure on salaries, which are continuing to grow.
Kerala claims that the Centre is withholding its due share in taxes. The Indian Express previously reported that the Kerala government, relying on an RBI report on state finances, has claimed that for every Rs 100 in tax collected, the Centre, on average, provides Rs 35 to the states. However, the Kerala government claims that it has only been receiving Rs 21 for every Rs 100 in taxes sent to the Centre.
Further, the Covid-19 pandemic and the cessation of Goods and Services Tax (2017) compensation has negatively impacted revenue collection in Kerala. When GST was introduced in 2017, it was done with the assurance that the Centre would compensate states for the shortfall in revenue collection for the next five years and with the understanding that annual tax growth rates would increase by the end of this period. However, the pandemic put an end to any notions of growth and the GST compensation period ended in June 2022.
The Kerala government approached the Supreme Court in December 2023 arguing that the imposition and reduction of Kerala’s Net Borrowing Ceiling is unconstitutional as “Public Debt of the State” is a subject included in the state list and the central government cannot limit the states’ borrowing capacity. The state government also claimed that Rs 26,000 crore is required immediately in order to avert a financial crisis.
What has the Supreme Court said?
On February 6, Attorney General R Venkataramani submitted a written note to the Supreme Court justifying the Centre’s intervention, stating that “debt of States affects the credit rating of the country” and that “default by any State in debt servicing would create reputational issues and will have domino effect”. He also claimed that the financial stress faced by Kerala was due to its own financial mismanagement.
During the February 13 hearing before a Bench of Justices Surya Kant and KV Vishwanathan, the court recommended that the Centre and the state of Kerala enter into negotiations between their respective finance ministries. Both sides agreed and Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal stated that a delegation from Kerala would be flown in the next day. Justice Kant stressed the importance of a genuine dialogue and stated “Let this not be an empty formality”.
However, on February 19, both parties returned to court having failed to reach a solution despite talks. Sibal said the Centre was reluctant to release the Rs 11,731 crore requested in the interim unless the Kerala government entirely withdrew the suit before the Supreme Court.
The Bench expressed its disapproval, indicating that a condition to withdraw the suit before any money is released would be outside the parameters of the constitution as states had a right to approach the court in the event of a dispute with the Centre under Article 131 of the Constitution.
Sibal maintained that the State of Kerala was entitled to Rs 13,608 crore and required an additional 15,000 crores in order to avert a crisis. Additional Solicitor General N Venkataraman expressed reluctance on behalf on the Centre, stating that if the SC entertained the suit and heard it beyond the request for interim relief, it would set a precedent for other states to approach the court as well leading to a “judicially unmanageable” situation.
On March 13, ASG Venkataraman return to court and stated that the Centre was willing to give Rs 5,000 crore with multiple conditions, including that this amount would be deducted from Kerala’s Net Borrowing Ceiling in the 2024-25 financial year. Sibal, on behalf of Kerala, rejected this offer stating that they were entitled to the money without conditions and that atleast Rs 10,000 crore was required.
The court will continue hearing the case on March 21.

"Why Delhi’s Dolma Aunty Momos challenged the use of her trade mark, what the law says",The court said in its order that she set up a small momo shop in 1994 and was the “first retailer” of the Tibetan delicacy in Delhi. Who registered a similar trademark to hers and what was the argument against it?,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/ch1608933.jpg?w=640,"Dolma Tsering, famously called “Dolma Aunty” by scores of Delhiites, owns the flagship momo shop of the same name in the city’s Lajpat Nagar area. (Express archives)","On March 6, the Delhi High Court cancelled a trademark registration titled “Dolma Aunty Momos” in the name of one Mohammed Akram Khan, after Dolma Tsering moved court against him for using her trademark.
Tsering, famously called “Dolma Aunty” by scores of Delhiites, owns the flagship momo shop of the same name in the city’s Lajpat Nagar area. The court said in its order that she set up a small momo shop in 1994 and was the “first retailer” of the Tibetan delicacy, which had since become popular across Delhi-NCR.
Tsering sought the cancellation and removal of Khan’s trademark. She contended that he registered her namesake trademark in 2018, causing her to move the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) in 2021.
However, since the IPAB was officially dissolved on April 4, 2021, by the Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021, and its functions were transferred to the high courts, the matter came before the Delhi HC.
Tsering applied for the “Dolma Aunty Momos” trademark in 2022 and it was granted to her on November 17, 2023. Essentially, she claimed that Khan had not only adopted her previously used trademark, flowing from the fact that she first set up her business in 1994, but that he was also using a trademark identical to hers and named after her.
A trademark is a symbol, design, word, or phrase that is identified with a business. Registering a trademark allows its owner to claim “exclusive rights” to its usage.
The Trademarks Act of 1999 governs the regime of trademarks and their registration in India. It guarantees protection for trademarks registered with the Controller General of Patents, Designs, and Trademarks, also known as the trademark registry.
According to Section 25 of the 1999 Act, once registered, a trademark is valid for 10 years and can be renewed by the owner periodically.
Also, using someone’s registered trademark without their authorisation amounts to its violation or infringement, as can using a substantially similar mark for similar goods or services. There is, however, another way in which trademarks can be infringed upon that relates to the Dolma Aunty case.
In Cadila Healthcare Limited vs. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited (2001), the Supreme Court said that passing-off is a “species of unfair trade competition or of actionable unfair trading”. One brand, through deception, attempts to pass off its product or service as another, to profit from its existing reputation.
The apex court ruled that the infringing products need not be identical, but the similarity in the nature, character, and performance of the goods of the rival traders has to be established to sustain a claim of “passing off”.
Take a situation where a brand logo is misspelt in a way that it isn’t easy for consumers to discern. For instance, ‘Adidas’ and ‘Adibas’. In such infringement cases, the trademark owner can take legal action and is entitled to remedies such as injunctions (orders to cease an action), damages, and accounts.
In Dolma Tsering vs. Mohd. Akram Khan & Another, Tsering was seeking cancellation of Khan’s trademark under Sections 11(1), 11(2), 11(3)(a), and 47 of the 1999 Act. While Section 11 provides grounds for refusal to register trademarks, Section 47 entails the removal of trademarks from the register and imposing limitations on the grounds of non-use.
Section 11(1) of the 1999 Act states that a trademark cannot be registered because of “its identity with an earlier trade mark and similarity of goods or services covered by the trade mark”, since “there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public…”
Similarly, a trade mark that is similar to another, even for two different goods or services, shall not be registered under a different proprietor’s name. This can be done if the first trade mark is “a well-known trade mark in India” and “use of the later mark without due cause would take unfair advantage of or be detrimental to the distinctive character or repute of the earlier trade mark,” Section 11(2) states.
Additionally, Section 11(3)(a) of the Act says that a trademark shall not be registered if its use in India is liable to be prevented by “any law,” in particular, the law of passing off, which protects an unregistered trade mark.
Besides this, Section 47 allows registered trademarks to be taken off the register once an application is made by an “aggrieved” person to the registrar or the appellate board. The grounds of such an application include “no bona fide use” (that is, not based on genuine intentions) of the trade mark or not registering the trademark with a “bona fide” intention, among others.
What did the court rule?
In its March 6 order, a single-judge bench of Justice Anish Dayal ruled that Khan’s trademark “be cancelled and removed from the Trade Marks Register.”
The court observed that due to the popularity of momos as a type of street food, Tsering had gained a “massive reputation,” adding that she also received several accolades for the quality of goods and services. Owing to the respondent’s non-appearance before the court in this court, the court also said that the allegations of non-use by Tsering went unrebutted and, therefore, would have to be accepted.

How the United States plans to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza,"The US solution to deal with hunger in Gaza, as Israel continues to pummel the Palestinian enclave while blocking overland access to almost all aid, is to deliver supplies using a floating dock and pier.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/2024-03-17T191842Z_215475339_RC2MN6AZUB5Y_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-AID.jpg?w=640,"Humanitarian aid falls through the sky towards the Gaza Strip after being dropped from an aircraft, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, as seen from Israel's border with Gaza, in southern Israel, March 17, 2024. (REUTERS/Amir Cohen)","US Army ships have sailed from Virginia with equipment to build a floating pier on the Gaza coast to deliver humanitarian aid to the enclave, Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj Gen Pat Ryder said on March 12.
“We expect the pier to be fully operational in approximately 60 days which will be able to facilitate the delivery of about 2 million meals per day,” Ryder said.
The project to build the floating pier — the American solution to deal with hunger and an impending famine in Gaza as Israel continues to pummel the Palestinian enclave while blocking overland access to almost all aid — is officially known as Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore (JLOTS).
Former Indian Navy officer Cmde Srikant Kesnur (Retd) told The Indian Express that JLOTS capabilities are used to transport cargo by sea when one or more ports cannot be operated or are not available for loading or unloading.
“Usually, JLOTS is part of a military campaign or exercise — either you want to fight in another country or you want to deliver aid and don’t have an operational port to embark or disembark. In most cases, it is assumed that loading (of cargo) would be well executed, but the unloading will happen over the shore,” Cmde Kesnur said.
Such operations usually involve joint operations by the forces — while the navy transports the goods and provides protection, the army or other agencies are involved in building the ‘last mile’ bridge, delivery, etc.
The floating pier in Gaza will be built with no “US boots on the ground”. The US will take the help of the private company Fogbow, which is run by former military and intelligence officials, according to a report by the BBC.
The project will consist of two main components, a floating dock and an approximately 548-metre-long pier with a causeway, the US Department of Defense has said.
The floating dock will be a platform built with pieces of steel, which will be delivered to the spot by a roll on, roll off ship — which is essentially a cargo ship with a platform to load and unload heavy cargo.
While the pier will be attached to the shore, the dock could be located up to a kilometre from the coast. The dock is required so that ships carrying aid don’t have to come close to the shore where they may possibly get stuck in shallow water, Maj Gen A V Krishna (Retd), a former officer of the Indian Army, told The Indian Express.
“They (the US) will send a ship (to supply the aid) that is (of) 40,000 tonnes. Anything smaller will be a costly business. Such a ship, depending upon the load, will require a depth of more than 4-5 metres, called minimum draft requirement. If it is less, the ship’s keel will get stuck, and it’s very difficult to pull out a ship that is embedded in sand,” Maj Gen Krishna said.
Once the ship unloads the aid on the dock, smaller Logistics Support Vessels (LSVs) will be used to transfer the cargo from the dock to the pier or jetty, which will be a floating structure linking to the shore. A pier can be built in three ways, Maj Gen Krishna said.
One, by using a “ribbon floating” bridge. “Such bridges are used for crossing rivers during wartime. They are strong and can be built within weeks. Each section of the bridge is about 6 metres by 6 metres, and the bridge is folded with the help of torsion bars in the form of a ‘W’. Once the roll on, roll off ship reaches the location, the bridge segments can be pushed into the water and connected end-to-end simultaneously, pushing the bridge towards the shore,” he said. Once the bridge touches the shore, anchors will be dropped on either side of each section to ensure the structure’s stability.
A second way is to use a different type of floating bridge, manufactured by the UK-based company Mabey, Maj Gen Krishna said. The Mabey floating bridge is constructed over a number of pontoons, which are small, flat-bottomed boats with anchors at each end.
On reaching the spot, the roll on, roll off ship will begin to push out the pontoons at right angles to the line of the bridge at the place where the pier is required.
“Say the ship is 500 metres from the shore. You will push out the first pontoon to a distance of 5-10 metres; then the second pontoon to another 5-10 metres. Over these two pontoons, a panel of the bridge will be made. Subsequently, a third pontoon will be pushed out and the previous two will be pushed further towards the shore,” Maj Gen Krishna said.
The process is repeated until the pontoons reach the shore. The bridge on the pontoons is typically a Bailey bridge, a truss bridge that is commonly used in mountainous areas.
The third way is to use a foam floating bridge made of elastomeric materials that are like rubber, but offer better material properties, Maj Gen Krishna said. Such bridges are commonly used in resorts. The US has heavy-duty versions of these bridges, but they are somewhat shaky, he said.
The pier will also have a causeway that will act as its extension. The causeway will ensure that vehicles carrying the aid from the pier to the coast don’t get stuck in boggy sand. Fogbow, the private firm, will move the aid from the shore to distribution points further inland by trucks, the BBC report said.
All floating bridges can take heavy weights such as tanks and cargo. They stay afloat because of buoyancy and density.
The principle of buoyancy states that any fully or partially submerged object experiences an upward force — known as buoyant force — equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.
Objects that are less dense than water stay afloat. That’s because they displace less water and therefore, the buoyant force is more than the gravitational force. Objects that are denser than water sink.
Notably, the ribbon floating bridge is made of steel, which is denser than water. To ensure that it remains afloat, the segments of the bridge are hollow, and contain an adequate quantity of air that makes them less dense than water. The floating dock will also have hollow steel segments.

The project to build the floating pier — the American solution to deal with hunger and an impending famine in Gaza as Israel continues to pummel the Palestinian enclave while blocking overland access to almost all aid — is officially known as Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore (JLOTS).
Former Indian Navy officer Cmde Srikant Kesnur (Retd) told The Indian Express that JLOTS capabilities are used to transport cargo by sea when one or more ports cannot be operated or are not available for loading or unloading.
“Usually, JLOTS is part of a military campaign or exercise — either you want to fight in another country or you want to deliver aid and don’t have an operational port to embark or disembark. In most cases, it is assumed that loading (of cargo) would be well executed, but the unloading will happen over the shore,” Cmde Kesnur said.
Such operations usually involve joint operations by the forces — while the navy transports the goods and provides protection, the army or other agencies are involved in building the ‘last mile’ bridge, delivery, etc.
The floating pier in Gaza will be built with no “US boots on the ground”. The US will take the help of the private company Fogbow, which is run by former military and intelligence officials, according to a report by the BBC.
The project will consist of two main components, a floating dock and an approximately 548-metre-long pier with a causeway, the US Department of Defense has said.
The floating dock will be a platform built with pieces of steel, which will be delivered to the spot by a roll on, roll off ship — which is essentially a cargo ship with a platform to load and unload heavy cargo.
While the pier will be attached to the shore, the dock could be located up to a kilometre from the coast. The dock is required so that ships carrying aid don’t have to come close to the shore where they may possibly get stuck in shallow water, Maj Gen A V Krishna (Retd), a former officer of the Indian Army, told The Indian Express.
“They (the US) will send a ship (to supply the aid) that is (of) 40,000 tonnes. Anything smaller will be a costly business. Such a ship, depending upon the load, will require a depth of more than 4-5 metres, called minimum draft requirement. If it is less, the ship’s keel will get stuck, and it’s very difficult to pull out a ship that is embedded in sand,” Maj Gen Krishna said.
Once the ship unloads the aid on the dock, smaller Logistics Support Vessels (LSVs) will be used to transfer the cargo from the dock to the pier or jetty, which will be a floating structure linking to the shore. A pier can be built in three ways, Maj Gen Krishna said.
One, by using a “ribbon floating” bridge. “Such bridges are used for crossing rivers during wartime. They are strong and can be built within weeks. Each section of the bridge is about 6 metres by 6 metres, and the bridge is folded with the help of torsion bars in the form of a ‘W’. Once the roll on, roll off ship reaches the location, the bridge segments can be pushed into the water and connected end-to-end simultaneously, pushing the bridge towards the shore,” he said. Once the bridge touches the shore, anchors will be dropped on either side of each section to ensure the structure’s stability.
A second way is to use a different type of floating bridge, manufactured by the UK-based company Mabey, Maj Gen Krishna said. The Mabey floating bridge is constructed over a number of pontoons, which are small, flat-bottomed boats with anchors at each end.
On reaching the spot, the roll on, roll off ship will begin to push out the pontoons at right angles to the line of the bridge at the place where the pier is required.
“Say the ship is 500 metres from the shore. You will push out the first pontoon to a distance of 5-10 metres; then the second pontoon to another 5-10 metres. Over these two pontoons, a panel of the bridge will be made. Subsequently, a third pontoon will be pushed out and the previous two will be pushed further towards the shore,” Maj Gen Krishna said.
The process is repeated until the pontoons reach the shore. The bridge on the pontoons is typically a Bailey bridge, a truss bridge that is commonly used in mountainous areas.
The third way is to use a foam floating bridge made of elastomeric materials that are like rubber, but offer better material properties, Maj Gen Krishna said. Such bridges are commonly used in resorts. The US has heavy-duty versions of these bridges, but they are somewhat shaky, he said.
The pier will also have a causeway that will act as its extension. The causeway will ensure that vehicles carrying the aid from the pier to the coast don’t get stuck in boggy sand. Fogbow, the private firm, will move the aid from the shore to distribution points further inland by trucks, the BBC report said.
All floating bridges can take heavy weights such as tanks and cargo. They stay afloat because of buoyancy and density.
The principle of buoyancy states that any fully or partially submerged object experiences an upward force — known as buoyant force — equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.
Objects that are less dense than water stay afloat. That’s because they displace less water and therefore, the buoyant force is more than the gravitational force. Objects that are denser than water sink.
Notably, the ribbon floating bridge is made of steel, which is denser than water. To ensure that it remains afloat, the segments of the bridge are hollow, and contain an adequate quantity of air that makes them less dense than water. The floating dock will also have hollow steel segments.

Analysing datasets: How predictive AI models are gaining traction,"While OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini have caught the fancy of people, companies and researchers – including oil and gas majors and pharmaceutical companies – are increasingly relying on generative AI for all kinds of purposes, such as oil exploration, drug discovery, etc.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/ai-explained.jpg?w=640,"Even as text-based generative AI platforms such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini have caught the fancy of people, companies and researchers around the world. (Reuters)","A volcano in Iceland erupted on Saturday (March 16) for the fourth time since December, the Icelandic Meteorological Office said, spewing smoke and molten lava into the air. One question that arose immediately was: Will it impact air travel? A 2010 eruption in Iceland had halted around 100,000 flights in Europe as ash clouds and haze enveloped the skies around the Arctic Circle, a key international flight path.
That’s where data analysis for pattern searches using Artificial Intelligence comes in. Beyond commercial applications, Moscow-based Yandex has introduced a service capable of monitoring volcanic ash movement and mitigating its impact on communities and ecosystems.
Given that volcanic ash presents a significant hazard, affecting regions across the globe with far-reaching consequences, Yandex, using advanced mathematical models and neural networks, has developed an interactive map that allows the real-time monitoring of ash clouds after eruptions. The idea is to empower authorities and communities to respond swiftly to ashfall and safeguard public safety and infrastructure.
According to Anna Lemyakina, Director of Strategic Projects at Yandex Cloud: “In projects such as forecasting volcanic ash dispersion, seamless and swift access to services for hypothesis testing and model training is crucial. Our project is readily scalable to monitor volcanoes worldwide, addressing the urgent issue of volcanic eruptions and their aftermath.”
Even as text-based generative AI platforms such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini have caught the fancy of people, companies and researchers around the world – including oil and gas majors, pharmaceutical companies, and manufacturing entities – are increasingly relying on generative AI for all kinds of purposes, including oil exploration, drug discovery and worker safety, among others.
For companies, the advantage is the trove of their own historical data which can become useful fodder for generative AI tools for predicting things. For instance, an oil drilling company with wells around the world has the historical geological data on the regions where all oil drilling has led to sucessful finds, and an AI system trained on this historical data could predict where a new oil well could be located.
Although, given the hype around generative AI, the term has also become a marketing buzzword. For instance, a number of digital wearables’ companies have repackaged some of their personalisation options as AI-first features. While the personalisation basis of a user’s typical habits is still a function of AI, it is nowhere near the sophistication – both in hardware and software – that generative AI platforms need.
A majority of the top 20 global oil and gas producers are learnt to be working on an AI strategy for their upstream (exploration) and midstream (pipeline and logistics) businesses. A recent EY survey indicated that more than 92 per cent of oil and gas companies around the world are “either currently investing in AI or plan to in the next two years.”
AI algorithms are being programmed to seek solutions for a variety of desired outcomes, especially for data-led interventions to sift through the large amount of data generated by past surveys and explorations to identify patterns and correlations that may escape other forms of analysis. AI for oil and gas can leverage the data produced by active wells during extraction to make predictions about probable reserves, provide predictions about the best ways to access known reserves, and extrapolate the lifetime yield of current wells.
Take for instance oil major Shell. Last year it forged a partnership with the AI software service company SparkCognition to develop a proprietary generative AI tool which can generate subsurface images for potential oil exploration opportunities.
As per the company, the traditional approach to subsurface imaging and data analysis is time-intensive and costly, relying on terabytes of data, high-performance computing, and complex physics-based algorithms to analyse and identify exploration opportunities.
However, the generative AI solution being developed by Shell and SparkCognition uses deep learning to generate reliable subsurface images using far fewer seismic shots—as little as 1per cent in completed field trials—than traditionally necessary while preserving subsurface image quality. The company says this will allow it to explore resources at a much lower cost.
Earlier this month, Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil producer, showcased its metabrain generative AI. According to Amin H Nasser, the company’s president and CEO, metabrain is helping Aramco to analyse drilling plans and geological data as well as historical drilling times versus costs and recommend well options. The model will also have the capability to provide precise forecasts for refined products, including pricing trends, market dynamics, and geopolitical insights.
Then there is the field of applying deep neural networks in drug discovery, which happens to be one of the most promising areas of research currently. “Predictive models are central to our work,” according to Friedrich Rippmann, Director, Computational Chemistry & Biology at Merck. “These are statistical models that predict whether a compound idea – a not-yet-synthesised molecule – will produce a desired activity.”
“The technologies we’re using mostly relate to machine learning. In particular, we’re using various types of deep neural networks. But we’ve also explored other more classical statistical techniques, with funny names like random forests and support vector machines.”
So far, in terms of practical benefit, the research carried out by Friedrich Rippmann’s team and Merck’s partners has made available almost 300 new models for assessing the properties of a compound, which can help predict their ability to bind to a specific disease-relevant target. “These models are already being used by our chemists to judge their compound ideas before deciding on whether to synthesise them,” according to Rippmann.
AI analysis is only as good as the quality of the datasets in use. For this reason, the pharmaceutical industry is increasingly seeking to collaborate by pooling data. A recent initiative to facilitate, the ‘MELLODDY Project’, involves the EU Innovative Medicines Initiative and around ten pharmaceutical companies in a project aimed at improving predictive models through so-called ‘federated learning’, by using a novel blockchain system to store data on a secure ledger while protecting the trade secrets of individual companies.

Tsering applied for the “Dolma Aunty Momos” trademark in 2022 and it was granted to her on November 17, 2023. Essentially, she claimed that Khan had not only adopted her previously used trademark, flowing from the fact that she first set up her business in 1994, but that he was also using a trademark identical to hers and named after her.
A trademark is a symbol, design, word, or phrase that is identified with a business. Registering a trademark allows its owner to claim “exclusive rights” to its usage.
The Trademarks Act of 1999 governs the regime of trademarks and their registration in India. It guarantees protection for trademarks registered with the Controller General of Patents, Designs, and Trademarks, also known as the trademark registry.
According to Section 25 of the 1999 Act, once registered, a trademark is valid for 10 years and can be renewed by the owner periodically.
Also, using someone’s registered trademark without their authorisation amounts to its violation or infringement, as can using a substantially similar mark for similar goods or services. There is, however, another way in which trademarks can be infringed upon that relates to the Dolma Aunty case.
In Cadila Healthcare Limited vs. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited (2001), the Supreme Court said that passing-off is a “species of unfair trade competition or of actionable unfair trading”. One brand, through deception, attempts to pass off its product or service as another, to profit from its existing reputation.
The apex court ruled that the infringing products need not be identical, but the similarity in the nature, character, and performance of the goods of the rival traders has to be established to sustain a claim of “passing off”.
Take a situation where a brand logo is misspelt in a way that it isn’t easy for consumers to discern. For instance, ‘Adidas’ and ‘Adibas’. In such infringement cases, the trademark owner can take legal action and is entitled to remedies such as injunctions (orders to cease an action), damages, and accounts.
In Dolma Tsering vs. Mohd. Akram Khan & Another, Tsering was seeking cancellation of Khan’s trademark under Sections 11(1), 11(2), 11(3)(a), and 47 of the 1999 Act. While Section 11 provides grounds for refusal to register trademarks, Section 47 entails the removal of trademarks from the register and imposing limitations on the grounds of non-use.
Section 11(1) of the 1999 Act states that a trademark cannot be registered because of “its identity with an earlier trade mark and similarity of goods or services covered by the trade mark”, since “there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public…”
Similarly, a trade mark that is similar to another, even for two different goods or services, shall not be registered under a different proprietor’s name. This can be done if the first trade mark is “a well-known trade mark in India” and “use of the later mark without due cause would take unfair advantage of or be detrimental to the distinctive character or repute of the earlier trade mark,” Section 11(2) states.
Additionally, Section 11(3)(a) of the Act says that a trademark shall not be registered if its use in India is liable to be prevented by “any law,” in particular, the law of passing off, which protects an unregistered trade mark.
Besides this, Section 47 allows registered trademarks to be taken off the register once an application is made by an “aggrieved” person to the registrar or the appellate board. The grounds of such an application include “no bona fide use” (that is, not based on genuine intentions) of the trade mark or not registering the trademark with a “bona fide” intention, among others.
What did the court rule?
In its March 6 order, a single-judge bench of Justice Anish Dayal ruled that Khan’s trademark “be cancelled and removed from the Trade Marks Register.”
The court observed that due to the popularity of momos as a type of street food, Tsering had gained a “massive reputation,” adding that she also received several accolades for the quality of goods and services. Owing to the respondent’s non-appearance before the court in this court, the court also said that the allegations of non-use by Tsering went unrebutted and, therefore, would have to be accepted.

How the United States plans to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza,"The US solution to deal with hunger in Gaza, as Israel continues to pummel the Palestinian enclave while blocking overland access to almost all aid, is to deliver supplies using a floating dock and pier.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/2024-03-17T191842Z_215475339_RC2MN6AZUB5Y_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-AID.jpg?w=640,"Humanitarian aid falls through the sky towards the Gaza Strip after being dropped from an aircraft, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, as seen from Israel's border with Gaza, in southern Israel, March 17, 2024. (REUTERS/Amir Cohen)","US Army ships have sailed from Virginia with equipment to build a floating pier on the Gaza coast to deliver humanitarian aid to the enclave, Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj Gen Pat Ryder said on March 12.
“We expect the pier to be fully operational in approximately 60 days which will be able to facilitate the delivery of about 2 million meals per day,” Ryder said.
The project to build the floating pier — the American solution to deal with hunger and an impending famine in Gaza as Israel continues to pummel the Palestinian enclave while blocking overland access to almost all aid — is officially known as Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore (JLOTS).
Former Indian Navy officer Cmde Srikant Kesnur (Retd) told The Indian Express that JLOTS capabilities are used to transport cargo by sea when one or more ports cannot be operated or are not available for loading or unloading.
“Usually, JLOTS is part of a military campaign or exercise — either you want to fight in another country or you want to deliver aid and don’t have an operational port to embark or disembark. In most cases, it is assumed that loading (of cargo) would be well executed, but the unloading will happen over the shore,” Cmde Kesnur said.
Such operations usually involve joint operations by the forces — while the navy transports the goods and provides protection, the army or other agencies are involved in building the ‘last mile’ bridge, delivery, etc.
The floating pier in Gaza will be built with no “US boots on the ground”. The US will take the help of the private company Fogbow, which is run by former military and intelligence officials, according to a report by the BBC.
The project will consist of two main components, a floating dock and an approximately 548-metre-long pier with a causeway, the US Department of Defense has said.
The floating dock will be a platform built with pieces of steel, which will be delivered to the spot by a roll on, roll off ship — which is essentially a cargo ship with a platform to load and unload heavy cargo.
While the pier will be attached to the shore, the dock could be located up to a kilometre from the coast. The dock is required so that ships carrying aid don’t have to come close to the shore where they may possibly get stuck in shallow water, Maj Gen A V Krishna (Retd), a former officer of the Indian Army, told The Indian Express.
“They (the US) will send a ship (to supply the aid) that is (of) 40,000 tonnes. Anything smaller will be a costly business. Such a ship, depending upon the load, will require a depth of more than 4-5 metres, called minimum draft requirement. If it is less, the ship’s keel will get stuck, and it’s very difficult to pull out a ship that is embedded in sand,” Maj Gen Krishna said.
Once the ship unloads the aid on the dock, smaller Logistics Support Vessels (LSVs) will be used to transfer the cargo from the dock to the pier or jetty, which will be a floating structure linking to the shore. A pier can be built in three ways, Maj Gen Krishna said.
One, by using a “ribbon floating” bridge. “Such bridges are used for crossing rivers during wartime. They are strong and can be built within weeks. Each section of the bridge is about 6 metres by 6 metres, and the bridge is folded with the help of torsion bars in the form of a ‘W’. Once the roll on, roll off ship reaches the location, the bridge segments can be pushed into the water and connected end-to-end simultaneously, pushing the bridge towards the shore,” he said. Once the bridge touches the shore, anchors will be dropped on either side of each section to ensure the structure’s stability.
A second way is to use a different type of floating bridge, manufactured by the UK-based company Mabey, Maj Gen Krishna said. The Mabey floating bridge is constructed over a number of pontoons, which are small, flat-bottomed boats with anchors at each end.
On reaching the spot, the roll on, roll off ship will begin to push out the pontoons at right angles to the line of the bridge at the place where the pier is required.
“Say the ship is 500 metres from the shore. You will push out the first pontoon to a distance of 5-10 metres; then the second pontoon to another 5-10 metres. Over these two pontoons, a panel of the bridge will be made. Subsequently, a third pontoon will be pushed out and the previous two will be pushed further towards the shore,” Maj Gen Krishna said.
The process is repeated until the pontoons reach the shore. The bridge on the pontoons is typically a Bailey bridge, a truss bridge that is commonly used in mountainous areas.
The third way is to use a foam floating bridge made of elastomeric materials that are like rubber, but offer better material properties, Maj Gen Krishna said. Such bridges are commonly used in resorts. The US has heavy-duty versions of these bridges, but they are somewhat shaky, he said.
The pier will also have a causeway that will act as its extension. The causeway will ensure that vehicles carrying the aid from the pier to the coast don’t get stuck in boggy sand. Fogbow, the private firm, will move the aid from the shore to distribution points further inland by trucks, the BBC report said.
All floating bridges can take heavy weights such as tanks and cargo. They stay afloat because of buoyancy and density.
The principle of buoyancy states that any fully or partially submerged object experiences an upward force — known as buoyant force — equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.
Objects that are less dense than water stay afloat. That’s because they displace less water and therefore, the buoyant force is more than the gravitational force. Objects that are denser than water sink.
Notably, the ribbon floating bridge is made of steel, which is denser than water. To ensure that it remains afloat, the segments of the bridge are hollow, and contain an adequate quantity of air that makes them less dense than water. The floating dock will also have hollow steel segments.

Analysing datasets: How predictive AI models are gaining traction,"While OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini have caught the fancy of people, companies and researchers – including oil and gas majors and pharmaceutical companies – are increasingly relying on generative AI for all kinds of purposes, such as oil exploration, drug discovery, etc.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/ai-explained.jpg?w=640,"Even as text-based generative AI platforms such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini have caught the fancy of people, companies and researchers around the world. (Reuters)","A volcano in Iceland erupted on Saturday (March 16) for the fourth time since December, the Icelandic Meteorological Office said, spewing smoke and molten lava into the air. One question that arose immediately was: Will it impact air travel? A 2010 eruption in Iceland had halted around 100,000 flights in Europe as ash clouds and haze enveloped the skies around the Arctic Circle, a key international flight path.
That’s where data analysis for pattern searches using Artificial Intelligence comes in. Beyond commercial applications, Moscow-based Yandex has introduced a service capable of monitoring volcanic ash movement and mitigating its impact on communities and ecosystems.
Given that volcanic ash presents a significant hazard, affecting regions across the globe with far-reaching consequences, Yandex, using advanced mathematical models and neural networks, has developed an interactive map that allows the real-time monitoring of ash clouds after eruptions. The idea is to empower authorities and communities to respond swiftly to ashfall and safeguard public safety and infrastructure.
According to Anna Lemyakina, Director of Strategic Projects at Yandex Cloud: “In projects such as forecasting volcanic ash dispersion, seamless and swift access to services for hypothesis testing and model training is crucial. Our project is readily scalable to monitor volcanoes worldwide, addressing the urgent issue of volcanic eruptions and their aftermath.”
Even as text-based generative AI platforms such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini have caught the fancy of people, companies and researchers around the world – including oil and gas majors, pharmaceutical companies, and manufacturing entities – are increasingly relying on generative AI for all kinds of purposes, including oil exploration, drug discovery and worker safety, among others.
For companies, the advantage is the trove of their own historical data which can become useful fodder for generative AI tools for predicting things. For instance, an oil drilling company with wells around the world has the historical geological data on the regions where all oil drilling has led to sucessful finds, and an AI system trained on this historical data could predict where a new oil well could be located.
Although, given the hype around generative AI, the term has also become a marketing buzzword. For instance, a number of digital wearables’ companies have repackaged some of their personalisation options as AI-first features. While the personalisation basis of a user’s typical habits is still a function of AI, it is nowhere near the sophistication – both in hardware and software – that generative AI platforms need.
A majority of the top 20 global oil and gas producers are learnt to be working on an AI strategy for their upstream (exploration) and midstream (pipeline and logistics) businesses. A recent EY survey indicated that more than 92 per cent of oil and gas companies around the world are “either currently investing in AI or plan to in the next two years.”
AI algorithms are being programmed to seek solutions for a variety of desired outcomes, especially for data-led interventions to sift through the large amount of data generated by past surveys and explorations to identify patterns and correlations that may escape other forms of analysis. AI for oil and gas can leverage the data produced by active wells during extraction to make predictions about probable reserves, provide predictions about the best ways to access known reserves, and extrapolate the lifetime yield of current wells.
Take for instance oil major Shell. Last year it forged a partnership with the AI software service company SparkCognition to develop a proprietary generative AI tool which can generate subsurface images for potential oil exploration opportunities.
As per the company, the traditional approach to subsurface imaging and data analysis is time-intensive and costly, relying on terabytes of data, high-performance computing, and complex physics-based algorithms to analyse and identify exploration opportunities.
However, the generative AI solution being developed by Shell and SparkCognition uses deep learning to generate reliable subsurface images using far fewer seismic shots—as little as 1per cent in completed field trials—than traditionally necessary while preserving subsurface image quality. The company says this will allow it to explore resources at a much lower cost.
Earlier this month, Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil producer, showcased its metabrain generative AI. According to Amin H Nasser, the company’s president and CEO, metabrain is helping Aramco to analyse drilling plans and geological data as well as historical drilling times versus costs and recommend well options. The model will also have the capability to provide precise forecasts for refined products, including pricing trends, market dynamics, and geopolitical insights.
Then there is the field of applying deep neural networks in drug discovery, which happens to be one of the most promising areas of research currently. “Predictive models are central to our work,” according to Friedrich Rippmann, Director, Computational Chemistry & Biology at Merck. “These are statistical models that predict whether a compound idea – a not-yet-synthesised molecule – will produce a desired activity.”
“The technologies we’re using mostly relate to machine learning. In particular, we’re using various types of deep neural networks. But we’ve also explored other more classical statistical techniques, with funny names like random forests and support vector machines.”
So far, in terms of practical benefit, the research carried out by Friedrich Rippmann’s team and Merck’s partners has made available almost 300 new models for assessing the properties of a compound, which can help predict their ability to bind to a specific disease-relevant target. “These models are already being used by our chemists to judge their compound ideas before deciding on whether to synthesise them,” according to Rippmann.
AI analysis is only as good as the quality of the datasets in use. For this reason, the pharmaceutical industry is increasingly seeking to collaborate by pooling data. A recent initiative to facilitate, the ‘MELLODDY Project’, involves the EU Innovative Medicines Initiative and around ten pharmaceutical companies in a project aimed at improving predictive models through so-called ‘federated learning’, by using a novel blockchain system to store data on a secure ledger while protecting the trade secrets of individual companies.

"R Ashwin: ‘I started weeping, locked myself in my room, wanted to quit cricket… Then I sought external help’",R Ashwin speaks on mental-health issues and how the perceptions of him being an ‘over-thinker’ affected his leadership chances. The session was moderated by Senior Assistant Editor Venkata Krishna B.,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/R-Ashwin-1.jpg?w=640,"India's R Ashwin during the award ceremony after India won the fifth Test cricket match over England, in Dharamsala, Saturday, March 9, 2024. India win the five-match series 4-1. (PTI Photo)","Why Ashwin: In the recently concluded series against England, R Ashwin, India’s leading spinner, crossed the landmarks of 100 Tests and 500 wickets. He played a big role in India beating England 4-1.
Nihal Koshie: BCCI told top cricketers that skipping domestic cricket when not on national duty would have its implications. The BCCI felt some cricketers were prioritising IPL over red- ball/domestic cricket. But when cricketers play all three formats and also take mental-health breaks, should the BCCI insist on that?
Sometimes when an organisation takes a stand, it might not suit everyone, it might not work in favour of everyone, it might be detrimental to a few people. What we must understand here is the message being conveyed by the organisational body here, it said we are prioritising Test cricket, IPL is not everything as far as we are concerned. They are saying Test cricket is of paramount importance, we are going to promote it and we expect people eligible to play this format. In my view, they are making all the right noises. At the same time, whether a cricketer wants to do all the 12 months, or only want to do the two months or whether they want to be relevant playing T20 cricket and one-day cricket and do not want to be playing Test cricket, is their choice.
Sandeep Dwivedi: Is there a trend among the younger generation of cricketers to market themselves on social media in a certain way? Like posting videos before selection day, wishing happy birthday to a certain group etc…
It’s very hard to make a complete assessment. In some cases, players don’t really handle their own social media handles. I like talking about cricket, which is why you see me on YouTube. I was always very instinctive, very upright, and somebody who loved the game to bits. And if I spoke about cricket to X, Y, or Z, I realized far later in my life that they see it as overthinking.
I would come back to my street and talk to friends about the same thing. That’s the culture I’ve been brought up in. So when I stepped out of Madras, I didn’t know what India was about. I give my opinion, but if I didn’t change my views or opinions, I wouldn’t be who I am today. Agreeing to disagree is the greatest quality one can have.
I didn’t even bother about when selections are happening. But now things have changed. There is a cricket Twitter war going on, on who should be there in the squad, what are the reasons somebody is selected. At the end of the day, we need to understand that there is a selection committee and things will have to happen according to what the team requires.
Whichever cricketer I sit around with, I tell them the same thing. PR and marketing will get you to a certain place. They might have value, but it’s only 1 percent.
Mihir Vasavda: How was it in the dressing room when you came and how is it now, especially when it comes to communication in Hindi?
It’s a cultural shock. My first shock came when I went for an Under-17 India team camp. All I had had in my life was curd rice at night. The next time I found curd rice was 45 days later. You can’t even explain that to somebody. I actually studied in Hindi but my Hindi fluency or vocabulary wasn’t good enough to speak.
It was neither’s fault. I’m a very proud Tamilian. But the first thing I would do to any child that comes to my academy is along with cricket, they should learn a bit of Hindi. Because the moment the child goes to an Under-14 or Under-16 NCA camp, the last thing you want the child to do is silently wonder what these guys are saying in Hindi behind their back. I would actually seriously recommend for people to understand that this (diversity) is the way of life and this is a beautiful country. We must embrace it.
Sriram Veera: M Vijay once said that he could never be himself in the dressing room because his sense of humour was in Tamil. How did you handle that?
I can empathise. He’s a very spirited soul but in my case, the fault was with me because you need to know which players to deal with and how. I’ve also made the effort to say ‘boss, this is who I am. I’m comfortable in my skin’. They will come around because they will also understand you. It has happened inside the Indian interesting room massively. It’s a question of maturing together. You play cricket for so many years; now Virat (Kohli) knows who I am and what sort of fun I enjoy. It’s got to a situation where he sends me jokes or links knowing exactly what I might know or enjoy. It’s the same thing with Rohit (Sharma).
Sandip G: Heard you are into chess these days. What are the other sports you follow?
I have been into a bit of online chess. I’m actually a big sports buff though looking at me physically, a lot of people think I can’t do much. I was pretty good at tennis. Not maybe the quickest around, but really, really good with my long-levers. I was pretty good at table tennis, and played a bit in the zonal sides, in ball badminton. I’m pretty good at racket sports. I can’t say I’m very good at chess, okay, for an amateur.
I watch chess a bit too, when Praggnanandhaa, Magnus Carlsen play. I watch a lot of Bobby Fischer games from the past. I follow a lot of Viswanathan Anand, his legendary duels with Gary Kasparov. I love the intricacies involved in the game.
Mihir Vasavda: Talking of intricacies, when Rohit retired out in the Super Over like you had done in the IPL, Rahul Dravid mentioned that was ‘Ashwin-level thinking’. How often do the players come to you to know about these complex situations?
All these things happen not because it’s discussed. It happens because of the execution. Somebody at the end of the day needs to have the courage to say, ‘okay, I am the guy that will receive the flak’. I still remember that day when Kings were playing Rajasthan in Jaipur. The moment that (mankading) happened, there was a huge buzz, a sort of a silence, and sort of a confusion amongst my own team. I called them into the huddle and said, ‘I know this will receive a lot of attention and flak, but I will handle it. Now, you guys get on with it and make sure we convert this into a victory.’ It shouldn’t disturb anybody else. And it turned out that we won the game. And yet again, it’s proved to me that when you put people in an uncomfortable spot, which they don’t like, they will perennially crumble. Because Rajasthan were cruising even without Jos (Buttler).
I have discussed tactical timeouts with so many captains, management, etc. they say, ‘yeah that’s a great idea’ but they’ll never do it. People talk about change, even these experts on social media who have so much advice to offer, do they get down and actually do it? Do they get their hands dirty? No, they don’t. If you do not have the courage to get yourself dirty, you will never be a part of change.
Devendra Pandey: From figuring out that Sangakkara doesn’t get LBW to off-spinners to watching videos of Williamson, Steve Smith, understanding the degree of turn on offer on different days of the Test… you have done it all. Could you explain your homework methods?
One day I was talking to Muttiah Muralitharan and he said, ‘put your batting on the back shelf a little bit and bowl a lot more. As you grow older you will learn a lot more about bowling and batting’. I found it to be interesting.
Bowling is a very conscious act because you deliver the first initial action while batting is a very subconscious act as you are reacting to something – – one is action and other is reaction. And I found when the person reacting is uncomfortable that is your first battle won. Ever since maybe 2016 or 2015 itself, I found myself in a zone to make batsmen uncomfortable at the crease. Which is why you don’t see me talking to a lot of batters. I found it peculiar that good batters want to see a bowler chatting to him and who is respecting him. Giving that space is something I always avoided.
My preparation is whether I can disturb the tempo of a batter. Whether Steve Smith would go to off-stump after ten balls or 12 balls. Whether Marnus Labuschange will try to sweep or reverse me first. Or Joe Root, when you go round the stumps in the first eight balls, he would reverse you once. There are two ways of skinning it, do I want to, stop Joe Root from reversing or do I want Root to reverse or get him out. That will depend on where Joe Root is in his career, how confident he is. Has he got a hundred in the first two Tests? Is he in confident space, is he coming from Sri Lanka after making mountains of runs? So I will try and make a plan because I want that early blood.
Sriram Veera: You had once said that the ‘overthinker’ label has stuck on you to work against you.
I didn’t understand. Everybody has unique methods. A method that’s worked for me, will not work for (Ravindra) Jadeja. The cricket community likes to keep it really simple. Unless it’s completely broken, they wouldn’t try to mend it. But I come from a school where even before it’s broken, I want to make sure I stitch it up and don’t get to a point where it’s broken. Why is it happening? That’s the question that people fail to recognise. I am addressing something before they believe I should address it. Because their journey is different and mine is different. They might get five opportunities but I will get only two. And I made peace with the fact that I will only get two.
It’s not like I change my action and tomorrow if I am leading a side, I would go to Jadeja and tell him that he should change his action. I’m not that dumb. In a way, people just assumed that that’s how it could be. They just thought he would not fit the bill as a leader and that’s quite an unfair assessment.
Sriram Veera: You had also said that if it was up to you, you would pick being a batsman instead of a bowler. Were you just emotional when you said that?
I don’t say anything just because I’m emotional. If I had a son or have daughters now who want to play cricket, I’d still make them bat, there’s no two ways about it. I’ll ask them to bowl so that they understand what a bowler thinks. Australia is the most successful cricketing country in the world. They’ve got some great batters. But consistently, they have been built by superstar bowlers for decades. They look after them. Pat Cummins was 19 or 20 when he had a stress fracture. He was looked after, was put in cotton wool, and paid his match fee for every single match he missed during that stint. He was treated like somebody who was extremely special, and Cummins has delivered results as a captain and player over the last three years. They know bowlers can win you championships. India is far from it. We do talk a lot about pitches. But batsmen have a lot more good days in India than bowlers do and even when they do have good days, they are not celebrated to the point where you inspire a youngster to say, ‘I want to bowl. I want to pick up a new ball and go’.
Sriram Veera: That general perspective is fine, but are you happy you became a bowler?
It’s destiny. Sometimes we have so much vanity that we don’t admit that destiny plays a role. Right people, right place, right advice. That’s what makes you who you are.
Forget me as being a bowler or a batter, why did I want to play cricket? I wanted to wear the Indian jersey and people to cheer for me. So that India celebrates India’s victories and they celebrate you. Indian victories were paramount, but I never knew Indian bowlers would never be paramount. I’m glad over the last decade you’ve got players, like (Jasprit) Bumrah, you’ve got players like me or Kuldeep (Yadav) who are celebrated far more than a player like Anil Kumble. I feel Kumble is the least celebrated legend of the game in this country. Zaheer Khan was a legend of this game but we didn’t celebrate him.
Venkata Krishna B: In a recent column for us, your wife Preethi had mentioned how in 2017, you went through counselling sessions. What made you seek outside help and could you talk about dealing with the pressure of playing at the highest level?
There are layers of mental health. Some people can succumb to pressure. Some are on the road all the time and can get jaded. Sometimes you are in a very dark place in your life that you want to talk to someone, and I think more often than not, people find themselves in the situation of a victim. Which is a very dangerous situation in my book.
Even though I have my family rooting for me and I can come back to my family, I cannot say a lot of things. I would say cricket, in many ways, is a corporate affair with a little bit of governmental organisational activities and attributes. Though If I come and talk with my dad about corporate stuff, he has only one line to say: It’s all politics. And that’s a very large line. And even fans end up doing the same thing. Occasionally, when I find myself in a dark spot, I have also done that a little. But it’s a very wrong thing to do because you feel somebody’s success is coming very easily. It’s not.
My wife is a wonderful listener, but she had a very young family and I was not giving her enough time. One fine day, we were having a conversation. My dad said something. And some internal affair of the house had broken down. And I said something to my dad. My dad and I fight a lot. And he eventually threw a statement “You know what? You are too upright and honest. That’s why you are getting screwed.” He made that statement and left. I am not someone who is emotive. I would like to think I am pretty strong but I just locked myself away. And then I started weeping. I was crying for a long time. I didn’t expect my dad to say that. I don’t think he even realized what he did.
I thought I am putting people in my house through a lot. I used to lock myself in the room. I never watched cricket. My room used to be dark all the time.
I decided to quit cricket. I was asking myself what would I do? And I said whatever I do in life, I would try to achieve excellence and be as good as I can be in that profession. I would probably try to do an MBA and probably be in marketing. I gave myself so many options and then thought before I make any decision, I must get crystal-clear clarity. Probably get an outsider’s view into my life. And see who I am, where I am. That’s when I sought some external help and it changed my life for the better."
"R Ashwin: ‘I started weeping, locked myself in my room, wanted to quit cricket… Then I sought external help’",R Ashwin speaks on mental-health issues and how the perceptions of him being an ‘over-thinker’ affected his leadership chances. The session was moderated by Senior Assistant Editor Venkata Krishna B.,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/R-Ashwin-1.jpg?w=640,"India's R Ashwin during the award ceremony after India won the fifth Test cricket match over England, in Dharamsala, Saturday, March 9, 2024. India win the five-match series 4-1. (PTI Photo)","Why Ashwin: In the recently concluded series against England, R Ashwin, India’s leading spinner, crossed the landmarks of 100 Tests and 500 wickets. He played a big role in India beating England 4-1.
Nihal Koshie: BCCI told top cricketers that skipping domestic cricket when not on national duty would have its implications. The BCCI felt some cricketers were prioritising IPL over red- ball/domestic cricket. But when cricketers play all three formats and also take mental-health breaks, should the BCCI insist on that?
Sometimes when an organisation takes a stand, it might not suit everyone, it might not work in favour of everyone, it might be detrimental to a few people. What we must understand here is the message being conveyed by the organisational body here, it said we are prioritising Test cricket, IPL is not everything as far as we are concerned. They are saying Test cricket is of paramount importance, we are going to promote it and we expect people eligible to play this format. In my view, they are making all the right noises. At the same time, whether a cricketer wants to do all the 12 months, or only want to do the two months or whether they want to be relevant playing T20 cricket and one-day cricket and do not want to be playing Test cricket, is their choice.
Sandeep Dwivedi: Is there a trend among the younger generation of cricketers to market themselves on social media in a certain way? Like posting videos before selection day, wishing happy birthday to a certain group etc…
It’s very hard to make a complete assessment. In some cases, players don’t really handle their own social media handles. I like talking about cricket, which is why you see me on YouTube. I was always very instinctive, very upright, and somebody who loved the game to bits. And if I spoke about cricket to X, Y, or Z, I realized far later in my life that they see it as overthinking.
I would come back to my street and talk to friends about the same thing. That’s the culture I’ve been brought up in. So when I stepped out of Madras, I didn’t know what India was about. I give my opinion, but if I didn’t change my views or opinions, I wouldn’t be who I am today. Agreeing to disagree is the greatest quality one can have.
I didn’t even bother about when selections are happening. But now things have changed. There is a cricket Twitter war going on, on who should be there in the squad, what are the reasons somebody is selected. At the end of the day, we need to understand that there is a selection committee and things will have to happen according to what the team requires.
Whichever cricketer I sit around with, I tell them the same thing. PR and marketing will get you to a certain place. They might have value, but it’s only 1 percent.
Mihir Vasavda: How was it in the dressing room when you came and how is it now, especially when it comes to communication in Hindi?
It’s a cultural shock. My first shock came when I went for an Under-17 India team camp. All I had had in my life was curd rice at night. The next time I found curd rice was 45 days later. You can’t even explain that to somebody. I actually studied in Hindi but my Hindi fluency or vocabulary wasn’t good enough to speak.
It was neither’s fault. I’m a very proud Tamilian. But the first thing I would do to any child that comes to my academy is along with cricket, they should learn a bit of Hindi. Because the moment the child goes to an Under-14 or Under-16 NCA camp, the last thing you want the child to do is silently wonder what these guys are saying in Hindi behind their back. I would actually seriously recommend for people to understand that this (diversity) is the way of life and this is a beautiful country. We must embrace it.

Al-Hilal’s record winning streak does not make them hall of famers,"That Al-Hilal has won 28 games in a row only points to the lack of competitive edge in the Saudi league; since its inception in 1974, Al-Hilal have been crowned champions 18 times, while a 19th title is sealed.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Al-Hilal.jpg?w=640,Al-Hilal extended their winning streak to 29 after they beat Damac 2-1. (Reuters),"Whatever the future of the Saudi Pro League be, Al-Hilal has achieved a slice of history. When they beat Al-Ittihad last week, they grabbed the record for the longest winning streak in the game’s record books. The record would be widely contested and criticized, but it was just the sort of positive publicity the league needed at a time when it was slipping out of football consciousness after the million-dollar storm it had whipped up since the acquisition of Cristiano Ronaldo last year and the subsequent exodus of Europe’s elite players.
Winning 28 games on the spin is a monumental feat anywhere in the world. But it comes with caveats, as records often tend to. Broadly speaking, there are two factors to weigh in. A) Is it truly the record? There of course would be claimants. For instance, FK Akradag, a club founded by former president of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, who himself designed the logo, last year went on a 33-game winning streak. In fact, they have won every game they have played. But the obscurity of the league, the uncertainty of its quality and the doubts over its integrity, as the ruler of the country is Berdymukhamedov’s son Serdar, were enough for the Guinness Book of Records (it’s not FIFA that approves the records) to cast aspersions on the nature and level of competitions.
In the post World War Two Era, Hungarian club Ujpest reportedly won 30 games in a row, but information of games in that era is sketchy.
Diligent recording of data in football began late, a reason several records are subject to debates. For instance, Pele’s goal tally of 1,279 strikes in 1,363 games, was fervently disputed, as many of the goals had arrived in celebratory games after retirement. He played 550 unofficial games, some of them against U-23 national teams (among them Saudi’s too), combined squads, regional teams and even in some military events while he served in the Brazilian army. In total, it’s believed that more than 500 of Pelé’s goals came in unofficial matches. “Who did you score them against?” Maradona once asked in an interview with Pele in a television program years ago. “Your nephews in the backyard?”
The second caveat dribbles in. Is the number really glittering, given the standard of the league?
The previous record, after all, was held by a little-known club on the Wales-England border The New Saints of Oswestry Town & Llansantffraid Football Club. They had beaten the record of surpassing Ajax’s 26 consecutive wins in the early 1970s when Johan Cruyff was their figurehead. In terms of quality and competitiveness of the league, Ajax’s achievement is considered the benchmark. And for the number to add glitter, the feat has to be achieved in the top five leagues of Europe. It would be an inhuman feat considering the ultra- cut-throatiness of the leagues. The closest any team has come to matching Ajax is Ajax itself, in 1994-95, the sparkling batch of Clarence Seedorf, Edgar Davids, Edwin van der Sar and Marc Overmars, an imperious batch won both the league and Champions League, dethroning AC Milan. Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Manchester City all came close in recent years, but fell short, demonstrating the difficulty of sustaining a winning streak in Europe.
Not that what Al Hilal achieved is trivial but it lacks the grandeur of the Ajax sides. It becomes a mere statistical embellishment, and not a sign of greatness. There are similar numbers and accomplishments that remain as mere figures. The name Erwin Helmchen might not ring a bell. But the German, who played in the 1930s, is the highest goal-scorer ever in league football. According to RSSSF statistics, the most authoritative stats engine for football records, he has scored 947 goals. But he is not talked about as one of the greatest-ever strikers, because the era he lived and played the game was different. Between Peter Shilton and Cristiano Ronaldo in the list of most appearances for clubs are Brazil’s Fabio (1311) and England’s Paul Bastock (1286), both goalkeepers aged 43 and 53 still plying in the lower leagues of their country. Neither strike a chord.
Every record and number thus needs contextualising. What can be gathered from Al-Hilal’s streak is that they enjoy a disturbing monopoly. Since its inception in 1974, they have been crowned champions 18 times, a 19th is on the way, as the sit 12 points adrift of Al Nassr, the club of Cristiano Ronaldo fame, have been Asian champions four times, a record. They have won five of the past seven titles, and seem destined to bag their sixth in eight seasons. They are Saudi’s best ever. No doubt. But the record doesn’t make them hall of famers.
Teams around them can learn. This season, they were the merriest spenders—shelling out 376.10 million pounds, 90 million spent on Neymar alone — but they were also the sharpest ones because they invested on players who have not yet slipped into their autumn. Neymar (who missed most of the season) is just 32, Milinkovic-Savic 29, Neves and Malcolm 27. All of them were aggressively chased by the giants of Europe, but could not match the Saudi giants in spending powers. They have played with clarity and intensity. They have set the standards, but unless the clubs around lift themselves, the impressive numbers they have been racking would remain of mere academic use. A trivia at best."

For instance, Pele’s goal tally of 1,279 strikes in 1,363 games, was fervently disputed, as many of the goals had arrived in celebratory games after retirement. He played 550 unofficial games, some of them against U-23 national teams (among them Saudi’s too), combined squads, regional teams and even in some military events while he served in the Brazilian army. In total, it’s believed that more than 500 of Pelé’s goals came in unofficial matches. “Who did you score them against?” Maradona once asked in an interview with Pele in a television program years ago. “Your nephews in the backyard?”
The second caveat dribbles in. Is the number really glittering, given the standard of the league?
The previous record, after all, was held by a little-known club on the Wales-England border The New Saints of Oswestry Town & Llansantffraid Football Club. They had beaten the record of surpassing Ajax’s 26 consecutive wins in the early 1970s when Johan Cruyff was their figurehead. In terms of quality and competitiveness of the league, Ajax’s achievement is considered the benchmark. And for the number to add glitter, the feat has to be achieved in the top five leagues of Europe. It would be an inhuman feat considering the ultra- cut-throatiness of the leagues. The closest any team has come to matching Ajax is Ajax itself, in 1994-95, the sparkling batch of Clarence Seedorf, Edgar Davids, Edwin van der Sar and Marc Overmars, an imperious batch won both the league and Champions League, dethroning AC Milan. Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Manchester City all came close in recent years, but fell short, demonstrating the difficulty of sustaining a winning streak in Europe.
Not that what Al Hilal achieved is trivial but it lacks the grandeur of the Ajax sides. It becomes a mere statistical embellishment, and not a sign of greatness. There are similar numbers and accomplishments that remain as mere figures. The name Erwin Helmchen might not ring a bell. But the German, who played in the 1930s, is the highest goal-scorer ever in league football. According to RSSSF statistics, the most authoritative stats engine for football records, he has scored 947 goals. But he is not talked about as one of the greatest-ever strikers, because the era he lived and played the game was different. Between Peter Shilton and Cristiano Ronaldo in the list of most appearances for clubs are Brazil’s Fabio (1311) and England’s Paul Bastock (1286), both goalkeepers aged 43 and 53 still plying in the lower leagues of their country. Neither strike a chord.
Every record and number thus needs contextualising. What can be gathered from Al-Hilal’s streak is that they enjoy a disturbing monopoly. Since its inception in 1974, they have been crowned champions 18 times, a 19th is on the way, as the sit 12 points adrift of Al Nassr, the club of Cristiano Ronaldo fame, have been Asian champions four times, a record. They have won five of the past seven titles, and seem destined to bag their sixth in eight seasons. They are Saudi’s best ever. No doubt. But the record doesn’t make them hall of famers.
Teams around them can learn. This season, they were the merriest spenders—shelling out 376.10 million pounds, 90 million spent on Neymar alone — but they were also the sharpest ones because they invested on players who have not yet slipped into their autumn. Neymar (who missed most of the season) is just 32, Milinkovic-Savic 29, Neves and Malcolm 27. All of them were aggressively chased by the giants of Europe, but could not match the Saudi giants in spending powers. They have played with clarity and intensity. They have set the standards, but unless the clubs around lift themselves, the impressive numbers they have been racking would remain of mere academic use. A trivia at best."
"IPL 2024: Shreyas Iyer declared fit to play for KKR, but with a rider",Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) captain Shreyas Iyer has been advised precautions to not aggravate his injury,https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/12/Shreyas-Iyer-3.jpg?w=640,Shreyas Iyer has been appointed as the KKR captain for IPL 2024,"SHREYAS Iyer, who had missed out the last two days of Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy finals citing back issues, has been declared fit to play the IPL but with a rider. The Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) captain, who joined the IPL franchise, has been advised that he can’t lunge too much while playing the forward defense as this could aggravate his injury.
The Indian Express understands that Iyer visited a spine specialist in Mumbai after consultation with the National Cricket Academy (NCA) Bangalore and the doctor has declared him fit to play with the precaution that he needs to be cautious while stretching his leg.
“He is fit to play, a specialist spine doctor was consulted in Mumbai who has advised him not to stretch his leg too forward while defending the ball. He has joined IPL franchise KKR and he can play,” a source in the Indian board informed.
Iyer has been in the news for his fitness issues in the last few weeks. Despite him stating that he is facing back pain after playing a certain number of balls, the BCCI medical team wasn’t convinced with his claims.
He was snubbed and scrubbed from BCCI’s annual retainer contract too after he bypassed selectors’ diktat of playing Ranji Trophy.
Iyer had missed Ranji Trophy quarter-finals but he played semis and final for Mumbai recently. He slammed 95 in the second innings in the final but didn’t turn up for fielding after he experienced back pain again. The MCA medical team decided to get an MRI done and his report was sent to NCA for further updates.
Iyer had complained of back pain after the second Test match between India vs England. However, NCA had declared him fit, even after his stating he was undergoing pain. Iyer was dropped from Test games thereafter and was asked to play Ranji Trophy. He missed Mumbai’s quarter-finals and it was then that BCCI secretary Jay Shah issued a letter to all contracted players stating domestic cricket remains a “critical yardstick for selection” to the national team.
The reason for the communication, according to the letter, was “the concerning trend of players prioritising the IPL over domestic red-ball cricket”. “There is a recent trend that has started to emerge and is a cause for concern. Some players have begun prioritising the IPL over domestic cricket, a shift that was not anticipated. Domestic cricket has always been the foundation upon which Indian cricket stands, and it has never been undervalued in our vision for the sport,” Shah said in the letter.
The 17th season of the Indian Premier League 2024 starts on March 22 with a mouth-watering opening clash between MS Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings and Faf Du Plessis led-Royal Challengers Bangalore at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. The schedule of the first 15 days was announced initially, while the roster for the remaining games is to be announced once the dates for the general elections are official. Ahead of the 2024 edition, New Zealand spinner and former Royal Challengers Bangalore bowler Daniel Vettori tops the list for the best economy in the history of IPL. Vettori bowled at an economy of 6.56 in his IPL career so far. He is followed by fellow RCB bowler and Indian legendary leg-spinner Anil Kumble. The bowler has bowled at an economy of 6.58 in his IPL career and is among one of the best middle-over bowlers in the history of the tournament. Australian legend and Delhi Capitals player Glenn McGrath has bowled at an economy of 6.61 in his 14-match career. He is followed by modern T20 maestro leg-spinner Rashid Khan, who goes at just 6.67 in his spells. Coming to last season in 2023, Punjab Kings all-rounder Mathew Short has been sensational with his economy. He has been able to bowl his overs at 6.25. Delhi Capitals' Pravin Dubey too has been miserly in three overs going at just 6.33. Gujarat Titans off-spinner who played just one game for them last season bowled at 6.50. Sunrisers Hyderabad's Glenn Phillips too has been tidy going at 6.66."

‘Ee sala cup namdu’: How Smriti Mandhana’s RCB spun their way to a historic title in Delhi,The tweakers grabbed nine wickets among them while Ellyse Perry steered her team past Delhi’s 113 with an unbeaten 35 and eight wickets to spare,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Royal-Challengers-Bangalore-players-wpl-title-pti-cropped.jpg?w=640,Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) players celebrate with the trophy after winning the WPL final against Delhi Capitals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi. (PTI Photo),"When the powerplay of Delhi Capitals innings was done, the scoreboard read 61/0. It was a whirlwind. The competition’s best partnership – Meg Lanning and Shafali Verma – were off to a flier. Especially the Indian youngster, who was once again showing off her ball-striking ability, stable base with all the focus down the ground. The ball was flying off her bat. She had reached 42 off 21 balls, Lanning was doing her part, playing the second fiddle as she tends to.
Then came Sophie Molineux’s 8th over at the end of which 64/0 became 65/3. In the space of four balls – that aptly read out W-0-W-W – the Aussie left-arm spinner dismissed Shafali Verma, Jemimah Rodrigues and Alice Capsey. Three of DC’s most destructive batters, all gone in a hurry. It was the over that changed the direction of the match decisively.
Royal Challengers Bangalore spun their way to a win, ending a long wait for a fanbase that has made their voice heard loud and clear from south to north. DC could just manage 113 batting first, RCB took their time but eventually got there with three balls to spare, with Richa Ghosh hitting the winning runs, and fittingly, Ellyse Perry remaining unbeaten on 35.
With Lanning and Marizanne Kapp still around, DC hoped for a fighting total. Given that 130-odd was defended a couple of nights ago at the venue, DC could hope. Shreyanka Patil, then, stepped up to the plate. In her second over, for the second consecutive match against Delhi, the RCB spinner got rid of Lanning. It was a blow from which DC never recovered.
The chase of 114 always felt like a matter of when and not if, and that was because RCB’s spinners brought their A-Game once again. When RCB pulled off a heist against Mumbai Indians in the semifinal, it was Shreyanka Patil, Sophie Molineux and Asha Sobhana who bowled the three crunch overs in the end. Those three would go on to share 9 wickets between them in a match-winning display of slow bowling.
Molineux, player of the final, felt like a shrewd addition to the franchise during the auction as she plugged a problem area for the team from last year: a wicket-taking spin bowler. This was despite Molineux not having been in action for Australia in international white-ball cricket since 2021.
But Shreyanka recalled a chat with Ellyse Perry during India’s home season against Australia. “When I played against Australia, Pez came up and told me that ‘Soph is going to be amazing. You’re going to learn a lot of stuff from her’. When I saw her, it was just amazing to watch her bowl in the nets. And then when she turned out, big match player, amazing to watch her,” Shreyanka said on Sunday.
The left-arm spinner’s first breakthrough was to have Shafali caught out at deep midwicket. Then Rodrigues and Capsey were bowled playing variants of the sweep shot. Molineux wouldn’t stop there, as she came up with a direct hit later to run Radha Yadav out.
Shreyanka’s four-wicket haul started off with Lanning’s LBW, this time with a classical offspinner’s dismissal, and ended with cleaning up the tail. Asha too chipped in with two big wickets in the middle overs as DC tried in vain to break the shackles. The job was nearly done.
RCB’s season turned out to be a rollercoaster, with an impressive start and then a blip in Delhi that included a last-over heartbreak against DC. After that match, head coach Luke Williams would say in the dressing room that he was confident the team’s best match was still in front of them.
Mandhana, RCB’s first-title winning captain echoed that. “Our Bangalore leg was really good. We had two tough losses here. And then that is what we talked about. The last league match was like a quarterfinal for us, then a semifinal and now the final. In such tournaments, you have to peak at the right time, so we saved our best for the last.”
Through the matches in Bengaluru and Delhi, RCB’s matches witnessed near full-houses. Mandhana was obviously aware of the expectations but tried to play it down every chance she got. “The only goal was to not talk about the goal,” she’d say after the Eliminator. “Focus on what was happening now and not on the 15 years gone by with the men’s side, we’re not really correlating anything that’s happened with the men,” she’d say before the Final.
But before going on to collect the trophy, she’d sign off in style. “I have a message for all the RCB fans, the most loyal fanbase. Nothing would have been possible without their support. Ee Sala Cup Namde (‘this year the cup will be ours’ in Kannada) always comes up when speaking about RCB. Now I just want to say Ee Sala Cup Namdu (this year the cup is ours).”"

Excerpts
How did you start off with handball?
I am from a sporting family and handball was always a main sport. My sister Marie is also active in athletics and successful in combined events.
What made you shift to athletics?
My sister went to the kids athletics programme and I joined her. I tried almost all disciplines, but throwing was always one of my favorites. I was very good as a kid in throwing the ball and when I became older, I chose the javelin.
At what age did you start focussing fully on javelin throw?
When I won my first title at the Under-16 German Championships. When I was 17, I decided to concentrate fully on the javelin throw
How do you look back at your 90 metre-plus throw and what were the reactions back home?
It was a throw for the history journals, I guess. The press here covered it like it was a sensational throw. Also a week after throwing 90 metres-plus, I started to feel like a ‘small star’. There were a lot of media requests (for interviews). The attention was a little too much but I think it helped promote the sport. Therefore I have no problems with this extra ‘stress’ along with my daily training program. Over the last few days, I have put my phone on silent mode as I started receiving messages and calls almost every second. I have not seen the video replays of my throw as I don’t want to rest on my laurels.
You had not crossed 80 metres before the Winter Throwing competition. Could you list out what helped you throw 90 metres?
I believe training, training and more training is what got me here. I was training very hard last winter as I was focused on improving my throws. Now, I have shown everybody that nothing is impossible… that at 19 years you can achieve such a result and success. My coach, Matthias Rau Coach at German Athletic Club, TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen, is the one who helped me improve so much.
Germany has great throwers who have crossed 90 metres many times. For a young German thrower, how important is it to cross 90 metres?
To cross the magic 90m mark was something very special for me. In all, 23 throwers have crossed 90 metres. So to join this special list makes me proud. I always wanted to throw 90 metres, but I never expected that I would achieve it so early.
How is your throwing style? What percentage is power?
I believe I have to improve a lot in my technique. I think currently my throwing is about 60 percent to 70 percent power and 40 percent to 30 percent technique.
What are your plans in the run up to the Paris Olympics? As you have thrown 90 metres, there will be focus on you…
I will try not to feel the pressure. I just want to enjoy the competition and hope I can repeat such a performance. The fans will watch me closer than ever before, but I will try not to get too influenced. I will follow the same routine.
Do you have a role model?
I don’t have a role model but I think there is a lot to learn about technique from Jan Zelezny (the world record holder).
Have you watched Olympic and World Champion Neeraj Chopra in action and what do you make of his throwing style?
Neeraj has an impressive technique which I follow carefully. I follow his throws in competitions all over and I am astonished with his flexibility.
Are you financially supported by the government or the sports ministry?
I am sponsored by my club, TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen and also by Deutsche Sporthilfe.
How do you relax when you are not training or competing?
I am a very keen motorcyclist. When I ride my bike I feel free and my mind is at ease."

(Photos courtesy Viren Rasquinha),"Lakshya Sen was returning from the US Open last April, but was so beat up and knackered from two weeks of tournament play, that he struggled to lug his own kitbag through the airport on his slouching, hurting shoulders.
His close team of coaches, trainers and family knew he was a terribly broken piece.
Almost a year on, Sen has made semifinals in back-to-back weeks at Paris and the All England and almost secured the Olympics quota. He hardly had any taping around his knee or shoulders, just some protective tape on the back. He’s flying like before in defense, but more importantly landing stably and has a jump and hit that’s fairly effective late in the third set.
In May of 2023, a month after the slumping trudge from the airport, he started on ‘shock training.’
The ‘shock’ is just 6 jumps, twice a week — only what’s needed for his sport, and he was initiated into them after he was at an advanced stage of strength conditioning. First employed by the legendary biomechanist trainer Dr Michael Yessis, who passed away at 90 last year, these were made famous by American world champ shot putters who weighed 130 kg, preferring ‘shock’ to squats in their plyometric training. They are intense on the knees, in that the impact is more neural than muscular. Such is the impact on the brain (head), that in 10 days of training on shock jumps, Sen’s jaw tightened.
But it’s how he could counter Lee Zii Jia in the quarters in the third set smash-brawl. Zii Jia smashes at 390 kph with barely any recoil, Sen staggered him with a bunch of jumping 320 kphs, but timed for the clutch.
There are other impressive numbers — Sen clocks 22.4 on the yo-yo test; Virat Kohli, with lesser demands in his sport and much older, is usually on 17.2. It shows Sen’s progress in lactic endurance — he can jump and hit when he wants, with strength and stamina in the third set.
On a treadmill, he can go for an hour, with 5 repetitions of 30 second spurts of Level 16 or 17, that’s trained him for a thumping heart rate. He climbs double ropes for shoulder strengthening. There’s bicep curls for arm power, because he isn’t naturally a hard-hitter like the Indonesians or Malaysians. And he’s put in work into calf strengthening for relentless attacks in the third set. He played 7 in the last two weeks, and won 6.
Viren Rasquinha, head of Olympic Gold Quest (OGQ), who helped put together Sen’s team with the Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy sports science centre, recalls Sen not being in great shape when going through a tough phase last year. Even after his injuries healed and the lab numbers were good, it took Sen another three months for results to show. “The drop in form with first round exits was perplexing because there was no injury and he was in the best shape. He was ticking all boxes on dedication, sleep and recovery. But we knew Lakshya was too good to not come good finally,” he recalls.
Getting 3 wins at the Badminton Asia Team Championships gave him confidence after losing to big names — meeting them early after his ranking slackened. But that was after his team had to convene to sort out his issues. “The group got together, and we had quarterly reviews of everything. None of us were confident of his qualifying then,” Rasquinha recalls.
It’s when Padukone demanded excellence in strength-stamina parameters on sports science test results, backed by daily data. “Lakshya’s peak power is now beyond elite levels,” Rasquinha says.
He would also train in 3-point shooting on basketball courts and a spot of kick boxing, but just for fun. Sen is not known to lift insane weights in the gym, and the treadmill is his go-run-to. And the major difference since last April is how the explosive jump is supplementing endurance. Vimal Kumar’s famous yells of “pace injection” in rallies now looks more seamless and stable on court, rather than the wild diving defensive retrieves all the time.
Now he flies when needed, but can arch, rotate, flex and extend without breaking down with injury. His speed and reflexes are as good as ever, despite the power injections.
He left his qualification till the end, but Rasquinha says it wasn’t planned that way. “No one wants it that way.
Everyone wants to seal it as quickly as possible. But 6 months after CWG gold were tough,” he says. “The nose surgery didn’t go well, and he had back and shoulder injuries,” he adds.
Sen would pivot back to Vimal Kumar as coach, moving from Anup Sridhar. “You cannot fault Anup for commitment. It was his bad luck that Lakshya couldn’t get results then. Maybe it’s Anup’s hard work back then that’s showing results now,” Rasquinha says. “For someone of Lakshya’s calibre, we left the decision to him. He decided to go back to Vimal Sir, whom he started with and fully trusts.”
Sen will need to remain injury free in coming months, and beware of over-training, though Instagram reels oftentimes push youngsters to hit the gym harder. He can get 10 percent more fit, according to his team. Rasquinha also warns of the training FOMO, where athletes live with daily worry of if another athlete is training harder, and err on the side of saturation.
Rasquinha is happy with Sen’s endgame fitness now though. “Like in hockey, when you might want that one last chance in the D on 59th minute, or that one tackle. In badminton, if it goes to 19-19, Lakshya is prepared to play at a high tempo in the decider.”
He tends to struggle to find good sparring though at the PPBA, with other elite shuttlers Kiran George and Mithun Manjunath having their own schedule to take care of. “We are thinking of sending some academy boys abroad with him when he plays because it gets tough for Vimal sir. But we have to look at costs, arranging visas, etc,” he says."

Fast forward a year, and Shreyanka has finished the second season with the Purple Cap as Royal Challengers Bangalore were crowned champions of WPL 2024 on Sunday at the Arun Jaitley Stadium. With figures of 4/12 in the final against Delhi Capitals, Shreyanka shot to the top of the leaderboard of the wicket-takers’ list.
The journey there, though, wasn’t straightforward. It seemed she was coming down with the case of a Second-Season Syndrome at the start of the tournament last month.
2023 was a whirlwind year for her — going from a breakthrough WPL to impressing in the Caribbean Premier League, then earning her India debut during the season.

But, starting off WPL 2024 at her home stadium in Bengaluru, Shreyanka seemed to be off the pace. Four matches, just two wickets — and in the match against Mumbai Indians, a hairline fracture on her non-bowling hand.
“She herself would admit that she didn’t start the tournament as well as she would have liked,” RCB assistant coach Malolan Rangarajan said in a press conference.
“But she was the first one to come up and say, ‘I am not bowling well. What can I do?’ She came up with the solutions too. Yes, we chipped in here and there, but that’s her character. When you see people like that, you know that when there are crunch moments, these characters will stand up and deliver.”
Shreyanka missed two matches due to the injury, which apparently she didn’t want to, but put the work in during the enforced break. Malolan said they rented out a couple of grounds, made her practice on centre wickets working on different releases. She wasn’t able to release the ball the way she wanted, so Shreyanka put in a lot of practice with her coaches, simulating match situations.
Lanning scalp
And as RCB moved to Delhi, Shreyanka’s fortunes changed. She picked up 11 wickets in four matches in the capital city. There were two four-wicket hauls in there, both against DC. And in both matches she picked up the big wicket of Meg Lanning, the Aussie superstar falling Leg Before Wicket. In the Eliminator, she swung the match decisively against MI, dismissing Harmanpreet Kaur in the 18th over, effectively the wicket that brought RCB to the final.

In the title clash, after the game-changing wicket of Lanning in her second over, Shreyanka came back to clean up the lower order.
“There was something in the wicket and if there is some little turn, I would love to take it to my advantage because I’m a different beast when I see some turn on the wicket,” Shreyanka beamed during the mid-innings chat.
“After we identified and then brought her into the set-up, you could see that she was not behaving like someone of her age or her experience. She was above that. She was always in for the fight. That’s the spark you’re looking for. Everyone has the skill but it’s a dogfight which happens inside and you’re up for it, Shreyanka always had it,” Malolan had said. “She is just a warrior, especially to play with the injury.”
The warrior came to the fore when the franchise needed it. India indeed have a gem on their hands."
Lakshya Sen’s run at All England Open ends after three-game semis defeat: ‘I know one thing that I must improve’,Too many long matches take a toll on young Lakshya Sen in three-game defeat to Indonesian Jonatan Christie,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/LAKSHYA-SEN-ALL-ENGLAND-CROPPED-AP.jpg?w=640,India's Lakshya Sen in action during the men's singles semi final match against Indonesia's Jonatan Christie at the All England Open Badminton Championships at the Utilita Arena in Birmingham on Saturday. (AP Photo),"Taking the scenic route to a destination is not the worst of things. The journey can be beautiful. But in sports, sometimes, it can prove costly. Lakshya Sen would know that all too well after his exertions of the last two weeks in Europe.
On Saturday, the 22-year-old from Almora in the hill-state of Uttarakhand gave himself another uphill task after a slow start. He recovered, briefly threatening to pull off another fabulous comeback, but ran out of steam against Indonesia’s former World No 2 Jonatan Christie. Lakshya bowed out of the All England Open Badminton Championships after a 12-21, 21-10, 15-21 defeat in 68 minutes.
That’s now back-to-back semifinal defeats for Lakshya over a fortnight when he played 9 hours and 19 minutes of badminton over eight matches, spending an average of nearly 70 minutes per match on the court. Only one of his eight matches was a straight-game affair, when he eased past Magnus Johannesen of Denmark in the first round in Birmingham.
The good news, as Lakshya’s team has been insisting, is that it shows how much his physical fitness and endurance have improved. That he won five of those deciding games is also an aspect he has improved from last year.
Looking forward, as a once-seemingly distant dream of Paris 2024 becomes a reality, the primary area of concern to address is starting matches better. That he dropped the opening game in five of those matches points to Lakshya getting off the blocks slowly, as he did against Christie. It is a problem he is aware of as he admitted fatigue played its part.
“All the matches that I’ve played were really long and I could feel it in the recovery, in the next day’s match preparation,” Lakshya said in the BWF mixed zone after the defeat. “Some matches, I started really slow in the first set, even having a good lead and then not being able to convert those first-setters that then went on to three games. I won some of those but I know this is one thing that I want to improve: close matches in two games. So that I’m a bit fresher.”
At his best, Lakshya usually plays net shots that just clear the top of the tape, making it difficult for opponents to counter him. Against Christie – who also has a solid net game – the shuttle was going a few inches higher than he’d have liked in the opening game. It gave Christie the chance to repeatedly punish him with close kills. It could well have been a case of the muscles being a bit too tight, and the shots being a tad loose. Those are the margins he had to improve, as he lost a glut of points from 6-6.

The course-correction happened quickly enough though. There was more tempo in the first six shots of the second game from Lakshya than most of the opener. And it wasn’t just all about pushing the pace, he varied it effectively as well to race to a 11-3 lead at the interval. Christie did find some rhythm after that break and as it did for Lakshya against Lee Zii Jia the night before, it gave him a foothold into the match.
The decider was off to a fantastic start in terms of quality from both players. But in an attempt to take control, Lakshya seemed to be over-exerting with his smashes, while Christie by default has a more energy-efficient strokeplay, A 325 kph winner from the Indian World No 19 for a 5-3 lead offered hope that he would carry on the momentum from the second game.
Then came a potential decisive 63-shot rally, where the exchanges went down to walking pace, that Christie sealed with a brilliant slow drop for a winner. From there on, the match started to slip away from Lakshya, who managed to stave off a few match points but the damage was already done.
Christie, not long ago, missed out on a World Championships medal after being 20-15 up in the third game. But he calmed himself down, overcame a few jittery moments, and lifted his arm up. The result meant a first all-Indonesian men’s singles final in three decades at the All England.
“As of now, I’m pretty disappointed with the result. But overall, the way I played the last two weeks, surely I have the level to be up there and win in the big tournaments,” Lakshya said.
The dream of going one better than he did in 2022 and matching the achievement of his mentor Prakash Padukone wasn’t to be realised this time.
“I’ll definitely sit back, and discuss with my coaches, try to analyse the two weeks much better because as of now I was just focusing on the next match after every game. Now it’s time to reflect, and watch those matches again. Take good things and keep learning from the mistakes that happen,” Lakshya signed off.
He couldn’t pull a rabbit out of the hat against JoJo, but the good news for Indian badminton is that Lakshya is most definitely on his way back and now knows what the next step is to level up further."

"Kejriwal skips ED summons in Delhi Jal Board case; BJP wants to fight Lok Sabha polls hiding behind ED, says AAP","In February, the ED searched various locations in Delhi, Varanasi and Chandigarh in connection with the Delhi Jal Board case, including premises linked to Arvind Kejriwal's personal assistant Bibhav Kumar.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/kejriwal_3b1a0e.jpg?w=640,Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday skipped the summons issued by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday in connection with alleged irregularities in the Delhi Jal Board. (File Photo),"Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday skipped the summons issued by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday in connection with alleged irregularities in the Delhi Jal Board (DJB). This is the first time that Kejriwal has been summoned by the central investigating agency in the case.
Calling the summons illegal, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders said it was another attempt by the BJP to use the ED to threaten the party. “When the CM has been granted bail by court, why is the ED sending summonses repeatedly? These are illegal. Why does the BJP want to contest the Lok Sabha polls hiding behind the ED?,” party leaders asked.
In February, the central agency had conducted raids at various locations in Delhi, Varanasi and Chandigarh in connection with the case, including at premises linked to Kejriwal’s personal assistant Bibhav Kumar and AAP Rajya Sabha MP N D Gupta. The agency has arrested retired DJB chief engineer Jagdish Kumar Arora and contractor Anil Kumar Aggarwal in the case.
The ED’s case is based on an FIR registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for offences related to alleged corruption and bribery in the DJB. It alleged that a contract to install electromagnetic flow meters was given to a company at “inflated” rates and the extra money was then paid as “bribes”, including to people linked with the AAP and to the party as “election funds”. The AAP has denied the allegations.
The BJP, meanwhile, said Arvind Kejriwal was evading questions because the allegations of corruption against him are true. “Kejriwal has evaded investigation yet again. Now it is clear that he is corrupt and something fishy is going on at the DJB,” Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said."

(Representational)","Two men posing as union ministry officials have conned a Jaipur woman promising scholarship money for her children, police said, adding that they have seized six mobile phones from the scamsters who were arrested by the Faridabad police on Sunday.
The accused, identified as Sonu and Narendra, residents of Rajasthan’s Deeg, contacted the woman identifying themselves as officials from the Ministry of Labour and Employment and claimed that her children had been awarded a scholarship of ₹130,000, said the police, detailing on how they lured the woman.
“To process the scholarship, some documents and processing fees were required, amounting to ₹20,000. The suspects sent a QR code to the victim, through which the woman transferred a total of ₹22,000 in 11 transactions,” said Faridabad police spokesperson Sube Singh.
He said that the cyber criminals were traced through the Ministry of Home Affairs’ portal, Pratibimb. A Faridabad officer saw a message on the app, which located the geographical location of the suspects, and found that the accused were currently in Faridabad. The Rajasthan Police were informed and the two suspects were handed over to them after arrest.
Singh mentioned that the Ministry of Home Affairs has initiated the Pratibimb portal to combat cyber criminals. Through this portal, the police keep an eye on cyber fraudsters and suspects.
If any cyber fraud is being committed in any area, information about it is provided to the cyber team through this portal. Information about the victim is also available on this portal.
The duo were arrested at Krishna Colony. Sonu is a Class 12 pass, while Narendra is in the final year. During interrogation, it was revealed that they had committed six incidents of fraud in Rajasthan.
Based on the woman’s complaint, a case of cyber fraud has been registered at Sanjay Circle Police Station in Jaipur."
Delhi Court allows jailed AAP leader Sanjay Singh to take oath as Rajya Sabha MP,Sanjay Singh was arrested in October 2023 in connection with the Delhi excise policy case and denied summons to take oath after his re-election as a Rajya Sabha MP.,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/01/sanjay-singh-aap.jpg?w=640,AAP MP Sanjay Singh.,"A Delhi Court recently granted permission to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Sanjay Singh, an accused in the Delhi excise policy case, to appear before the Parliament on Tuesday to take oath as a Rajya Sabha member. Singh was recently elected to Rajya Sabha for a second term but denied summons to take oath.
The court of Special Judge M K Nagpal also directed the Tihar jail authorities to ensure that the accused is taken to Parliament under adequate security and that he is not permitted to use his phone or talk to other accused persons.
Singh was arrested on October 4, 2023, following 10 hours of searches at his North Avenue home. He was the third AAP leader to be arrested in the case, following former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and the party’s communications in-charge Vijay Nair.
The ED alleged that an accused businessman, Dinesh Arora, who later turned approver in the excise case, had given Singh Rs 2 crore in cash. It also alleged that Singh had ensured changes were made in the liquor policy through Sisodia to favour certain businessmen.
Calling Singh a “key conspirator”, the ED, in its remand application, had said: “Sanjay Singh has exploited and gained illegal money/ kickbacks, which is ‘proceeds of crime’ generated from the liquor policy (2021-22) scam…(he) has been part of the conspiracy of collecting kickbacks from liquor groups…(he) has a close relationship with Dinesh Arora since 2017 as revealed by Dinesh Arora as well as from his call records."

Those who are gone are gone. Don’t worry about them. But yes, they will come back when you come back to power. Do not welcome them then,” Kharge said.
Recalling his conversation with a leader from Maharashtra who recently quit the party, Kharge said, “He had come to me and cried saying how ED and CBI were targeting him. I said, will you give up on your principle because you are being threatened.”
Addressing the gathering earlier, Thackeray said that he will not back down despite people quitting his party. “This is the time when we all unite. Those who tried to divide us will be defeated. Those who are joining you (BJP) are not the real electorate. The real electorate is sitting in front of me. Irrespective of people quitting, we will fight,” he said.
Bihar’s Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav, too, mentioned about splits in the Shiv Sena and the NCP. “I want to tell Uddhavji and Sharad ji that they (BJP) took your legislators only.

‘Allegations in complaint not true’: Police close sexual assault case against Sajjan Jindal,"According to the complainant, the Jindal sexually assaulted her on January 24, 2022 and she approached police on February 16, 2024.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/jindal.jpg?w=640,"Sajjan Jindal, chairman and managing director of JSW Group. (File Photo)","Police have closed the investigation into the rape and criminal intimidation case against Sajjan Jindal, chairman and managing director of JSW Group, on the complaint of a 30-year-old woman, saying the allegations in the complaint were not found to be true.
The Bandra Kurla Complex police, which probed the matter, filed a B-Summary (closure) report before the Bandra Metropolitan Magistrate Court on March 16.
According to sources, the closure report states that the complainant filed the complaint a long time after the incident, failed to submit evidence and failed to appear before the court to record her statement under 164 CrPC procedure.
“The complainant has stated that on December 24, 2021, the accused visited her at Taj Land End and tried to molest her. But on the day of the incident, the accused did not go to the said place. This was ascertained from the correspondence with the said hotel. The said conclusion was also drawn from the testimony of the witnesses there,” police said in the closure report.
From the testimony given by the witnesses, who were present at the place of the alleged incident, it has been concluded that there was no wrongdoing with the woman as mentioned in the FIR, police said. “On the whole, our investigation has revealed that the said case has been filed by the complainant with the intention of framing the accused in a false crime. Therefore, it is requested to grant B- summary of the said crime,” the report stated.
Zonal Deputy Commissioner of Police Dixit Gedam did not respond to queries, however, sources confirmed that after the police filed a closure report, the court issued a notice to the complainant intimating about the development, seeking her response.
According to the complainant, Jindal sexually assaulted her on January 24, 2022, and she approached police on February 16, 2024. In her statement, the complainant also cited a couple of similar incidents prior to January 24, 2022.
On December 5 2023, the woman filed a petition in the Bombay High Court, alleging that police did not act on her complaint. On December 12, the BKC police informed the HC that the woman’s statement would be recorded and action would be taken.
An FIR was lodged on December 13. A day later, police informed the court that the woman’s statement had been recorded and an offence was registered under Indian Penal Code sections 376 (rape), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 506 (criminal intimidation).
However, finding that the allegations were not true, the case was closed, police said, adding the complainant also failed to produce sufficient evidence to corroborate her claims.
According to police, the complainant met Jindal during an IPL match in Dubai on October 8, 2021, where she was in the VIP area along with her brother.
“My brother is a property consultant, and as Jindal wanted to buy some property, he shared his number with us, following which my brother asked me to get in touch with him,” the complainant said in her statement.
According to the statement, on December 18-19, she and her brother met Jindal at the wedding of a politician’s son in Jaipur. The statement cites two instances — on December 27, 2021, and January 5, 2022 — when Jindal allegedly sexually assaulted her at his house on Peddar Road and office in BKC respectively. She also mentioned a similar incident on January 24, 2022, at his office in BKC.
Police sources claimed that the statement of witnesses did not corroborate the allegations made by the complainant. The senior inspector of the BKC police station Raghunath Kadam did not respond to phone calls and messages.
Earlier in a statement, Jindal had denied the allegations as “false and baseless”.

(Express File Photo),"The Left Front on Sunday announced its candidate for Alipurduar parliamentary seat, while maintaining that it still wants to stitch together an alliance for the Lok Sabha elections with parties that are “opposed to the BJP and TMC.”
The Left Front announced Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) leader Mili Oraon as its candidate from Alipurduar seat in north Bengal.
The announcement came after a meeting of the Left Front parties at the Communist Party of India (Marxist) office in Kolkata.
The first phase Lok Sabha polls is on April 19 and voting will be held in three constituencies – Cooch Behar, Alipurduar and Jalpaiguri.
With Sunday’s announcement, the Left Front has fielded candidates from all three seats going to polls in the first phase.
Addressing a press conference, CPI(M) state secretary Mohammed Salim said, “We are holding discussions with other parties and making all attempts to forge an united alliance. We are stitching together an alliance of different political forces that are opposed to BJP and TMC…
We have put in our efforts and there are positive signs. We are hopeful. It is a work in progress,” said Salim.
Sources in the Congress said the party high-command is likely to announce its candidates for West Bengal on Monday. “The party’s central leadership will announce the first batch of candidates for West Bengal on Monday. We are expecting that names of candidates for the second and third phase election will be announced tomorrow,” said a senior Congress leader.
The parties comprising the Left Front are CPI(M), CPI, RSP and All-India Forward Bloc (AIFB).
Last Thursday, the Left Front had announced its candidates in 16 Lok Sabha seats and kept the door open for future talks with the Congress for seat-sharing in West Bengal. On the same day, The Indian Secular Front said that it will field candidates from eight constituencies in West Bengal in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, while maintaining that it still wants to keep seat-sharing talks open with the Left Front for key seats."

The ruling party, however, denied the allegations and cautioned against “spreading wrong information”.
The incidents come a day after the Model Code of Conduct came into effect following the announcement of the poll schedule. The 18th Lok Sabha polls in West Bengal will be held in seven phases from April 19 to June 1, across 42 constituencies.
According to reports, BJP alleged that its worker Jaideep Das (40) was assaulted by TMC supporters in Balurghat Lok Sabha constituency in Dakshin Dinajpur district.
The party’s state unit chief Sukanta Majumdar and MLA Satyendranath Roy met Das at a hospital in Gangarampur and assured him assistance. The BJP has decided to field Majumdar from Balurghat. He is the sitting MP from the seat.
“Another case of political violence reported from Gangarampur, under PS-Gangarampur, Dakshin Dinajpur district. All this is happening at the behest of Mamata Banerjee, who refuses to reign in criminals and instruct WB Police to act… A written complaint has already been filed at the Gangarampur police station. The EC must take urgent note of the deteriorating law and order in the state of West Bengal,” BJP leader Amit Malviya wrote on ‘X’ on Sunday.
Denying the allegations, West Bengal Minister Chandrima Bhattacharya said, “Things are very peaceful. I will request everyone to refrain from spreading wrong information.”
In the second incident reported from Paschim Bardahman, the BJP accused TMC workers of setting on fire a shop owned by one of its women leaders. The shop owned by Rina Thakur was located in Pandaveswar area of district. The incident took place around 2 am Saturday in Jamai Para area of Pandaveswar under Asansol Lok Sabha Constituency.
Thakur, who is the secretary of BJP Mahila Morcha’s Pandaveswar unit, alleged that TMC activists had been threatening her to leave the party since she joined BJP six months ago. “I was being threatened ever since I joined the BJP. My shop was set on fire on Saturday,” she said
Denying the allegations, the Trinamool claimed that there could be a personal grudge behind the incident. “I don’t think it is a political issue. Maybe, the incident was a fallout of a personal grudge,” said a TMC leader.
Meanwhile, candidates from different political parties hit the campaign trail and interacted with voters in their constituencies. TMC candidates and actors Sayani Ghosh and June Malia were seen campaigning in Jadavpur and Medinipur respectively.
According to TMC leaders, Malia will start campaigning in Egra from March 18 and would subsequently be touring Keshiyari, Dantan, Kharagpur and Medinipur."

An official in the Raj Bhavan said that Bose, during a recent visit to New Delhi, went to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and held discussions with experts on the matter. He then constituted the committee, which includes former secretary of the department of agriculture, cooperation and farmers’ welfare, S K Pattanayak, and a Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) expert to study the issue and suggest ways of land utilisation in Sandeshkhali, the official said."
Chandrakant Patil urges BJP cadre to work against Sharad Pawar in Baramati: ‘time to take revenge’,"Shrinivas Pawar, brother of Ajit Pawar, stands by his uncle, and says the BJP always wanted to finish Sharad Pawar in politics.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/baramati-lok-sabha.jpg?w=640,"The Nationalist Congress Party led by Ajit Pawar has launched an intense election campaign against Supriya Sule, the sitting MP and candidate of NCP (SP), in Baramati. (File Photos)","After prominent BJP and Shiv Sena leaders in the Baramati parliamentary constituency spoke out against Ajit Pawar publicly, senior BJP leader Chandrakant Patil decided to take the reins of the Lok Sabha election campaign in Baramati in support of the NCP.
Even as Patil urged party cadres to take revenge against NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar) chief Sharad Pawar by voting for the candidate Ajit Pawar would field on the Baramati seat, Shrinivas Pawar, brother of Ajit Pawar, has come in support of his uncle Sharad Pawar.
The Nationalist Congress Party led by Ajit Pawar has launched an intense election campaign against Supriya Sule, the sitting MP and candidate of NCP (SP), in Baramati with Sunetra Pawar, Sule’s sister-in-law and the wife of Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, as the possible candidate of NCP. The NCP, which is part of the NDA, had reportedly raised concern over the leaders of BJP and Shiv Sena led by Eknath Shinde not cooperating in the election campaign.
Now, Chandrakant Patil, who is the coordinator of NDA for four Lok Sabha seats of Pune, Baramati, Shirur, and Maval, is leading from the front to activate the cadres of the BJP in Baramati.
While addressing the party cadres in Baramati on Sunday, Patil said, “Sharad Pawar has twice cheated the BJP and its leaders to form an alliance government in the state. The distribution of ministries and posts of guardian ministers were finalised but Sharad Pawar backed out saying the party cadre won’t agree to the alliance”.
“This is only one per cent of the secret. I am saying this as I can’t disclose everything. Thus, it is the time to take revenge for the insult and cheating done by Sharad Pawar of BJP and its leaders. It should be done by voting for the candidate of Ajit Pawar in Baramati,” the Maharashtra minister said after visiting Sunetra Pawar at her residence in Baramati.
His visit came after BJP leader Harshvardhan Patil openly spoke about the threat by leaders of alliance parties (NCP) to him over moving about in the Indapur constituency. He has been holding party meetings but seeking support for forthcoming Assembly polls instead of the Lok Sabha elections. Shiv Sena leader Vijay Shivtare has also publicly declared he would teach Ajit Pawar a lesson during the Lok Sabha elections 2024 for the treatment meted out to him by the NCP in the past.
On his part, Shrinivas Pawar, Ajit Pawar’s brother, has come out in support of his uncle Sharad Pawar. At a meeting with villagers in Baramati, he said the BJP and RSS want to finish the career of Sharad Pawar and they have been trying this for long. “We are aware of the contribution of Sharad Pawar in the progress of Baramati. It was wrong to leave him alone in this situation,” he said.
He also said that if someone loans a farm for tilling doesn’t mean the one farming owns the land in an indirect reference to Ajit Pawar being given the responsibility of Baramati in the past.
Meanwhile, Shrinivas Pawar’s son Yugendra Pawar has already started campaigning for Supriya Sule in Baramati.
NCP (SP) legislator and grandnephew of Sharad Pawar, Rohit Pawar said the stand taken by Shrinivas Pawar is the stand of the common public. “The Pawar family has over 100 members and all follow the same ideology. It is Ajit Pawar, his wife, and two sons who have decided to go another way so they have isolated themselves from the rest of the Pawar family. The Pawar family was united and will always remain together,” he said."

Pune Crime Files: When ‘Naxal’ posters appeared across city around Bhagat Singh’s martyrdom day,"The posters appeared in 2012 and 2013, the latter carrying freedom fighter Bhagat Singh's image and calling to support the rights of “revolutionaries” lodged in jails on the occasion of his ‘Shaheed Din’.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/naxal-poster-pune-crime-files.jpg?w=640,"Poster bearing name of banned CPI-Maoist and image of Bhagat Singh put up in Pune on March 23, 2013. (Express Photo)","Over a decade ago, “Naxal” posters came up across Pune city ahead of the martyrdom day of freedom fighters Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev on March 23 for two consecutive years – 2012 and 2013.
The posters bearing the name of the banned Communist Party of India (CPI-Maoist) were spotted on the walls of the Patrakar Bhavan, a building in Navi Peth that houses a prominent organisation of working journalists in Pune.
Similar posters were also seen at the district collectorate, some bus stops and inside a few buses of the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) and they called for a “bandh” in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha from March 21 to March 23, 2012.
As stated on the posters, the Maharashtra state committee of the CPI-Maoist demanded unconditional release of its “comrades Kobad Ghandy, Vijay, Vikram, Madanlal, Mahesh, Bhanu and Angela”, calling them “revolutionaries”, and slamming the government as corrupt and unjust.
Police sources point out that the posters were put up at a time when a probe by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) was underway against alleged CPI-Maoist operative Angela Sontakke and others, including members of the Pune-based Kabir Kala Manch who were arrested during April-May 2011 under sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), for allegedly spreading the Naxal ideology of armed struggle against the government in urban areas.
All accused in this case, including Angela, were later released on bail by the court. Angela’s husband Milind Teltumbde, a central committee member of the CPI-Maoist, was gunned down by the police during an encounter with Naxals in Gadchiroli in November 2021.
Later, on March 23, 2013, posters mentioning the CPI-Maoist were found again at prominent and strategic spots in the city like Patrakar Bhavan, Garware College, S P College, Shramik Bhavan, Swargate Junction, Shaniwar Wada, Balgandharva auditorium and the Shivajinagar court.
The posters in 2013 carried freedom fighter Bhagat Singh’s image. It called the period between March 23 and March 29 as the “Sangharsha Saptah” in support of the movement demanding rights for “revolutionaries” lodged in jails, on the occasion of the “Shaheed Din (Martyrdom Day)” of Bhagat Singh.
Through the posters, the “CPI-Maoist” also made six demands – give the status of political prisoners to the revolutionaries lodged in jail, those sentenced to life imprisonment should get all facilities like other ordinary prisoners, rights should be given to meet the jail inmates secretly, the prison inmates should get proper facilities as per the jail manual, ban should be lifted on the literature being given to the revolutionaries and special privacy should be given to female prisoners when needed.
While no case was registered in 2012 for putting up the alleged Maoist posters, in 2013 the Pune city police booked unidentified persons under sections of the Prevention of Defacement of Property Act.
The police obtained a video captured by a CCTV camera at Patrakar Bhavan, which allegedly showed three young men arriving on a motorcycle and putting up the posters on the night of March 23, 2013. Their faces or details of the motorcycle were not visible clearly in the video and the investigation also yielded no leads.
According to the police, such “Maoist” posters never reappeared in the city after 2013. However, they continued to act against the alleged Maoist operatives from Pune and other urban areas.
In September 2014, alleged CPI-Maoist members Arun Bhelke and Kanchan Nanaware of Chandrapur were arrested by the ATS from Pune. In January 2021, Kanchan succumbed to an illness in jail. Arun was convicted under UAPA sections and sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment by a special court in Pune in December 2022. He was released from jail in April 2023.
Meanwhile, several activists including three artists of the Kabir Kala Manch were arrested for alleged Maoist links under UAPA sections in connection with the Elgaar Parishad-Koregaon Bhima case of 2018. The police have alleged that the Elgaar Parishad was organised in Pune on December 31, 2017 as per the strategy of the banned CPI-Maoist and using its funds. However, the accused in this case have denied all the allegations."
Police arrest two bank account holders in multi-crore online share trading scam,The arrests were made during investigation of a cyber fraud case recently lodged at the Wakad police station by a woman residing in the locality.,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/arrest_f7695b.jpg?w=640,"Between January 2 and March 5, the woman transferred Rs 10,69, 575 to the fraudulent bank accounts and never received the assured returns. (Representational photo)","Pimpri Chinchwad police have arrested two bank account holders in connection with a multi-crore online share trading scam. Police have identified the two accused persons as Vikas Neminath Chavan (43) of New Sangvi and Pradip Krushna Lad (32) of Pimple Gurav.
The arrests were made during investigation of a cyber fraud case recently lodged at the Wakad police station by a woman residing in Wakad.
Police said the cyber fraudsters shared information about a share market investment with the complainant on Facebook in January this year. Luring her to invest money by promising huge returns, they added the woman to a WhatsApp group. Believing that all members of this WhatsApp group were earning profits on a daily basis in online share trading, the complainant too agreed to invest her money.
She then received a call on her WhatsApp number from a woman who asked her to fill up a form for investing money in “IBKR Securities” company. Police said the complainant woman was then asked to transfer her money into 11 bank accounts. She was also asked to download one “IBKR app” on her cell phone.
Police said that this was a fake application designed by the cyber criminals. The fake application deceitfully displayed high returns to the complainant, but she was not able to withdraw her earnings.
Between January 2 and March 5, the woman transferred Rs 10,69, 575 to the fraudulent bank accounts and never received the assured returns. Based on her complaint, an FIR was lodged against the fraudsters under relevant sections of the IPC and sections of the Information Technology (IT) Act.
Following a technical probe into the bank accounts in which the complainant’s money was transferred, cops identified and arrested two accused Vikas Chavan and Pradip Lad on Saturday.
As per the press release issued by DCP (crime) Sandip Doifode, the accused Chavan is a furniture businessman and Lad works in real estate. Police seized two cell phones from the accused during the investigation. The accused were found to be booked for similar offences in the past, the police said.
“Bank accounts in the name of the two accused persons were used for the cyber crime. A court has remanded the two accused to police custody for five days for further investigation,” said senior police inspector Vaibhav Shingare.
According to police, “Probe revealed that the 11 eleven bank accounts in which the complainant’s money was transferred were used for transactions of more than Rs 50 crores. Also, about 20 complaints from different parts of the country have been received against the accused persons in this case.”"
"Lok Sabha elections 2024: Raju Shetti seeks Uddhav Sena’s support for Hatkanangle seat, but slams MVA",Shiv Sena (UBT) spokesperson Sanjay Raut said the party was ready to back farmer leader Raju Shetti in Lok Sabha elections 2024 .,https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/12/raju-shetti.jpg?w=640,Farmer leader and former MP Raju Shetti (Express Photo by Ashish Kale),"A day after he met Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray and sought his support for contesting the Hatkanangle seat in Maharashtra in Lok Sabha elections 2024, farmer leader Raju Shetti on Sunday said he does not intend to join Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) ”as it has worked against the interest of farmers when it was in power.”
“Yesterday I met Uddhavji and sought his support for my candidature from Hatkanangle Lok Sabha seat,” Shetti, who heads the Swabhimani Paksha, told The Indian Express. Hatkanangle seat spans Sangli and Kolhapur districts.
Shetti said Thackeray had promised to decide in a couple of days. ”We had a cordial meeting. I told the Sena chief that they don’t have a strong candidate in Hatkanangle and, therefore, they should announce their support to me. Uddhavji has promised to decide after consulting the Sena leaders in Sangli and Kolhapur districts,” Shetti said.
When contacted, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said the Sena was ready to support Shetti but had put a condition on it. ”We are ready to support Shetty’s candidature for the Hatkanangle seat. We have told him that he should be a Shiv Sena-sponsored Maha Vikas Aghadi candidate. The ball is in his court. He told us that he would get back to us. Anyways, we will soon take the decision on his request,” Raut said.
Shetti said he could not join the MVA ahead of Lok Sabha elections 2024 because it had worked against the interest of the farmers. ”The MVA, when it was in power, had amended the law and reduced the compensation given to farmers to acquire their land for development purposes. The government is constructing Shaktipeeth Expressway from Nagpur to Goa. For this, it is acquiring 27,000 acres of land, but the farmers will be getting paltry compensation due to the amendment made by the MVA during its tenure. The Mahayuti government has made no change in it. And therefore, we are against both MVA and Mahayuti,” he said.
In 2019, Shetti lost to Dhairyasheel Mane from the Hatkanangle seat. At that time, Mane was with the Shiv Sena, led by Uddhav Thackeray. Since then, he has switched allegiance to the Shiv Sena, led by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde. Mane is likely to be fielded again by the Shinde Sena.
Shetti said he has approached Uddhav Sena for support, not the ruling Mahayuti alliance of Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde), the BJP and the Nationalist Congress Party (Ajit Pawar). ”But some Mahayuti leaders who approached me urged me to contest on a BJP ticket. Why should I contest on a BJP ticket when I have my own separate party? I am not interested in joining Mahayuti,” he said.
Shetti said since both the MVA and Mahayuti are ready to support him, they should ensure his unopposed election. ”Both MVA and Mahayuti are not against me and are ready to support me. Why can’t they ensure an unopposed election to the Lok Sabha? Can’t they have one strong farmers’ voice in the Lok Sabha?” he asked."
"Against All Odds: Wheelchair-bound at 20, COEP topper and national tennis player from Pune turned his life around with sheer willpower","Today Amit Bhargava is the vice-president of a firm dealing with the biofuel supply chain, a single parent, and an avid mountaineer.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/IMG-20240317-WA0033_501ee9.jpg?w=640,"Always a merit-list student, Amit studied at COEP Technological University from 1998 to 2002 after finishing school at Loyola, Pune.","The third year of college is a crucial time in a student’s life. It is when one decides the course of one’s career, from taking up internships to shortlisting universities and so on. For Amit Bhargava, this year was a game-changer in more ways than he had bargained for.
Always a merit-list student, Amit studied at COEP Technological University from 1998 to 2002 after finishing school at Loyola, Pune. His academic brilliance was well-matched by his sporting prowess as Amit played lawn tennis and represented his school and the Pune University in the National Games, where he bagged bronze and silver medals. In 2001, he was adjudged the best hockey player even as he was the captain of his college tennis team.
Besides, Amit was a footballer. And it was during one of his football matches at the Army Institute of Technology in Dighi that the 20-year-old suddenly collapsed on the field in February 2001. It was a paralytic stroke. “It paralysed the entire right side of my body, my face, hands and legs,” he says.
Recalling the day, Amit’s father Pradeep Bhargava says, “He was on the football ground in the afternoon, a very fit boy, suddenly horizontal on the hospital bed at the end of the day. His hands and legs were just there, no movement. I kept hoping that the doctor would come out and say this is temporary.”
Out of nowhere, Amit’s life changed from a busy college schedule of lectures, sports sessions and hanging out with friends to the beginning of a long, laborious and lonely struggle. The determined youth, however, decided to start by promising himself that he would not wallow in self-pity.
He was in the hospital for about 12 days. “Since my entire right side was affected, I started off on a wheelchair and got onto a walker and then switched to a stick,” he recounts. About five months later, he also started doing aqua aerobics to regain his movement.
But the physical recovery was not the toughest part of the journey. “From being an active sportsperson, it came down to zero activity. I couldn’t step out of the house. I first had to get mentally in tune with what had happened, a process in which my friends and family helped a lot. Some also grew distant, which helped me understand who my true friends were,” says Amit, who decided to attend lectures and appear for his exams. “I was on medication, which made me very sleepy and I had trouble concentrating. I would study for half an hour and then give my mind and body some rest,” he said.
Even then, he still could not write. So Amit got a writer, appeared for three semester exams and still bagged distinction. “It is one thing to dictate for subjects like English and History, but with engineering graphs and equations it is very tricky,” Pradeep adds. In the meantime, Amit started training himself to write with his left hand, which is now his dominant hand.
“After the stroke, there was no movement in the right side and that part of the brain also got affected, blood flow stopped there and it effectively became dead. So the recovery lay in training the surrounding parts of the brain to do all the activities I was used to,” explains Amit.
After engineering, he appeared for an interview for a leading IT firm in Pune. “But my speech was slurred, I wasn’t confident while talking to people. It added to the overall feeling of wanting to give up,” he recalls. Nevertheless, he bagged the job and went on to work there for two years, rebuilding his confidence during the period.
Amit had by then given up on his dream of studying abroad, but physiotherapy helped him strengthen the right side of his body and he started to experiment with sports again. “I started playing a little bit of tennis, a year or two after the stroke. But I wasn’t able to play well, so I moved to table tennis, then badminton.”
After two years at the IT company, Amit decided to pursue an MBA. He appeared for the entrance, wrote it with his left hand and felt confident to move to Delhi after he secured an admission. Pradeep recalls, “He stayed in the hostel on his own, topped the course, and even went to Singapore through the college. In Singapore, he did bungee jumping! But called to tell me only after he had done it,” says Pradeep, beaming with pride.
Once he was back in India, Amit’s life began to look up and he met Meenu. From colleagues, the two became a couple and got married in 2008. Two years later, they had a daughter, Suhana. Just when everything seemed set, Meenu passed away in 2017, forcing Amit to dip once again into his deep reservoir of strength to overcome the blow.
Today, at 43, Amit is the vice-president of a company dealing with the biofuel supply chain. The single parent is also a mountaineer who goes trekking to the Sinhagad fort once a week and has already completed three Himalayan treks.
“It wasn’t easy because of the instability. There is always that little extra struggle. But then life is unpredictable. It is important to have an open mind when things change. The sooner you adapt, the better it is,” Amit says."

Willingness of a senior Bollywood actor and two sportspersons has also been sought to contest polls from the ‘City Beautiful’.

The Union Territory (UT) will be voting on June 1 on the last phase of Lok Sabha election, results of which will be announced on June 4. The ticket for Chandigarh is yet to be announced by all the three major parties – BJP, Congress and AAP.
Chandigarh BJP’s former president Sanjay Tandon, ex-mayor Arun Sood, former MP and leader Satya Pal Jain were pitching in strongly for their candidatures, insisting that a local candidate should be given a chance this year.
“However, there has been a feedback that if a local face is fielded, there may be internal sabotage and the other group within the party itself may not let him win. So, those from outside are being considered too as Kirron was sent in 2014 and 2019 Lok sabha polls too,” a senior BJP leader said.
The leader added that a “senior” Bollywood actor and two sportspersons were also approached for contesting the elections. “In consideration were a senior Bollywood actor and two sportspersons as they were also reached out but the sportspersons, I am told, have refused,” the BJP leader said.
The possibility of Kher being repeated was also discussed but she did not get a “positive feedback” from the local workers of the BJP. “Like actor Hema Malini has been repeated for the third time from Mathura, there were discussions if Kher is being repeated from Chandigarh. However, local workers within the party have not submitted a positive feedback and fielding the same candidate could lead Congress’s win. Though it is yet to be finally discussed,” the saffron party leader said.
Surprisingly, in the list suggested by the BJP Chandigarh, Kher’s name was not mentioned, while that of Tandon, Sood were present.
When AAP dented Congress’s share
The AAP dented vote bank of Chandigarh Congress in the last few years especially on its debut in general election 2014 and now this 2024 Lok Sabha polls will see the the two supporting each other – a hope for Congress to clinch back the seat it used to win consistently.
In 2014, the AAP declared Gul Panag as it’s candidate from Chandigarh, who managed to secure an encouraging number of votes – 1.08 lakh, while Congress’s Pawan Bansal got 1.21 lakh votes. Kher, who was contesting for the first time in 2014 for BJP, secured 1.91 lakh votes to claim the Chandigarh constituency.
The vote share suggests that in 2014, the BJP had got 42.2 per cent of the votes polled while the Congress managed 26.8 per cent. Then new entrant AAP managed to get respectable 24 per cent votes. The AAP’s gain was Congress’s loss as the party’s share dipped considerably down from 46.7 per cent in 2009 polls to 26.8 per cent.
However, in 2019, AAP’s vote share came down significantly to just 3 per cent while Congress’s vote share rose to 40.35 per cent. In 2019, Congress’s Bansal lost to Kher with a margin of 46,970 votes.
Both Congress and AAP are likely to contest the LS polls this year together with both parties set to support the grand old party’s candidate. An arrangement from both the parties ensured AAP’s victory for the seat of mayor and now Congress is hoping to reclaim the Chandigarh seat with AAP’s backing.
“The 2014 polls saw AAP denting a major vote bank of Congress because till date Chandigarh has seen a contest majorly between Congress and BJP. Though AAP’s vote share reduced in 2019 polls, the party bounced back in Municipal Corporation polls after reducing BJP’s seat share in civic body which means people in Chandigarh are really wanting change now,” a senior Congress leader said."

Both Congress and AAP are likely to contest the LS polls this year together with both parties set to support the grand old party’s candidate. An arrangement from both the parties ensured AAP’s victory for the seat of mayor and now Congress is hoping to reclaim the Chandigarh seat with AAP’s backing.
“The 2014 polls saw AAP denting a major vote bank of Congress because till date Chandigarh has seen a contest majorly between Congress and BJP. Though AAP’s vote share reduced in 2019 polls, the party bounced back in Municipal Corporation polls after reducing BJP’s seat share in civic body which means people in Chandigarh are really wanting change now,” a senior Congress leader said."
"World Sleep Day: ‘OSA increasingly prevalent due to urbanisation, changing lifestyles’","Prof Naresh Panda, Head, Department of Otolaryngology, PGI, highlighted the fact that OSA is becoming increasingly prevalent in India due to urbanisation, changing lifestyles, and a rise in risk factors such as obesity and sedentary behaviour.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/sleep.jpg?w=640,"in one study, 72 patients with mild OSA were given a customised diet over 12 months and significant reduction in baseline energy, fat, carbohydrate intake and BMI was noted, and they had significant improvement in their snoring and mild sleep apnea. (Pexels)","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder characterised by repetitive pauses in breathing during sleep due to the collapse of the upper airway. These interruptions in breathing can occur multiple times per hour, leading to fragmented sleep and decreased oxygen levels in the bloodstream. Common symptoms of OSA include loud snoring, daytime sleepiness, morning headaches, and difficulty concentrating. Left untreated, OSA can have serious consequences on both physical and mental health. Individuals with untreated OSA are at a higher risk of developing hypertension, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and depression.
Prof Naresh Panda, Head, Department of Otolaryngology, PGI, highlighted the fact that OSA is becoming increasingly prevalent in India due to urbanisation, changing lifestyles, and a rise in risk factors such as obesity and sedentary behaviour. Prof Sandeep Bansal said in recent years, OSA has been on the rise, affecting millions worldwide. Despite its prevalence, OSA often remains undiagnosed, leading to severe health complications and financial strain. “Early detection and effective management of obstructive sleep apnea are crucial in mitigating its adverse effects and reducing associated costs,” he says.
Various studies have been conducted in the department, and in one study, 72 patients with mild OSA were given a customised diet over 12 months and significant reduction in baseline energy, fat, carbohydrate intake and BMI was noted, and they had significant improvement in their snoring and mild sleep apnea. An observational study was conducted in 64 patients with OSA to assess their dietary habits and it was found out that though most of the patients were obese, only 3.6% of them were aware of the relation between obesity and OSA and most of them had a misconception about the type of food they consumed with a high calorie of about 40 kcal/kg/day.
Another important study was a randomised control trial where 56 obese OSA patients’ anthropometry, blood investigations and sleep study were analysed before and after 6 months of dietary intervention which gave an eye-opening outcome where there was a significant decrease in various biochemical blood parameters, weight and BMI. “As part of our efforts to raise awareness, we encourage individuals to familiarize themselves with the signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea and seek medical evaluation if they suspect they may be affected,” shares Bansal.
Pediatric OSA, said the doctors can have significant consequences for a child’s health and development, and untreated pediatric OSA can lead to impaired growth and development. Children with untreated OSA may experience cognitive deficits, including difficulties with attention, concentration, and memory. They may also exhibit behavioural issues such as hyperactivity, irritability, aggression, and poor school performance. Daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and mood disturbances may affect social interactions, academic performance, and participation in extracurricular activities. OSA and obesity often coexist in children, and one can exacerbate the other. Untreated OSA may contribute to weight gain and obesity due to disruptions in metabolic processes and alterations in appetite-regulating hormones.
“Children with OSA may be more prone to bedwetting and can lead to recurrent upper respiratory infections, chronic cough, and asthma exacerbations. Treatment options, adds Prof. Bansal, may include lifestyle modifications, such as weight management and positional therapy, as well as medical interventions such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy or surgical procedures to address anatomical abnormalities."

AAP MLA in trouble over ‘callous’ remarks to farmers,"Legislator accuses them of being 'defaulters, blackmailers.'",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/aap-punjab.jpg?w=640,Farmers questioning Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Balluana Amandeep Goldy Musafir at the public meeting in Bahavwala village (Fazilka).,"Balluana AAP MLA Amandeep Singh Goldy Musafir on Saturday appeared to have got into hot water with two members of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Sidhupur over his ‘callous’ remarks against the duo who (MLA) reportedly accused them of being “defaulters and blackmailers”.
At a public function of the MLA in Bahavwala village (Fazilka), the two farmer leaders questioned the legislator about water shortage in the area. Farmers were upset over no water supply in Sukhchain Minor (canal) for more than a month and the problem was compounded by the Sirhind feeder canal now also being closed (from March 15 onwards) for relining work, thus aggravating shortage of water in Muktsar and Fazilka districts where wheat crop is at near-ripening stage, and kinnow orchards too need water.
As Amandeep Singh Goldy Musafir’s meeting was going on, he lost his cool when he was interrupted by the duo’s questioning on water shortage. The MLA asked the duo to meet him after the function. Police was asked to show them the door.
A video of the farmers questioning the MLA has gone viral on social media. Farmers themselves have shared it online.
Though the MLA met the two farmer leaders after the meeting, he accused them of being “defaulters and blackmailers” while interacting with the media later.
The alleged remarks by the MLA did not go down well with the duo and the matter was brought to the notice of BKU Sidhupur president Jagjit Singh Dallewal, who is also the coordinator of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (non-political). In response, Dallewal demanded an unconditional apology from the MLA.
Talking to The Indian Express, Dallewal said, “The MLA should publicly apologise for using unkind words against the two farmer leaders. Also, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann should take strict action against the lawmaker. The farmer leaders were only demanding proper supply of canal water, but instead of hearing them out, he accused them of being defaulters and blackmailers.”
The media questioned the MLA after the video went viral.
Meanwhile, the MLA told the media persons, “I sit in my office for four days in a week, but they never come to me for any problem. Whenever I go to a public function, they come with questions and try to interrupt the ongoing programme. I told them to wait and meet me after the function. And I kept my word and met them.”
When asked, was he rude with the duo? Denying it outright, the MLA said, “No, I was not rude. Instead I just told them the truth that they shouldn’t interrupt the function. They come for making videos and reels.”
But when the MLA met the duo after the function, he did not allow them to make a video of that meeting, revealed information.
The farmer who questioned the MLA is Nirmal Singh, convenor of BKU Sidhupur (Abohar branch). The two farmer leaders belong to Bahavwala village (Balluana constituency) of Fazilka district.
Reacting to this, Sukhmander Singh, president of BKU Rajewal (Fazilka district), said, “Though the two farmer leaders are not from our union, as a farmer community, we will not tolerate this kind of allegation against our fellow men by the MLA, and we will lodge protest against these remarks.”
Darshan Singh of Giddranwali village (Abohar) and another union leader of BKU Rajewal said, “Already we are upset over untimely withdrawal of water from Sirhind feeder canal in the name of relining work which has taken a toll on our agriculture work, and when farmers question on this basic need, they are subjected to this kind of mistreatment. We will also protest at Sirhind feeder in Ferozepur on Sunday morning. Sukhchain Minor is already without water supply for more than a month. The water supply from Sirhind feeder canal was stopped on March 15 and its effect will be felt in our area by tomorrow or the day after. Instead of the MLA taking up our cause, he is levelling allegations against the farmers.”
Sukhchain Minor (canal) is from Lambi to Abohar, but it is kuchha, claimed the MLA. According to him, the work to make it pucca was stopped by farmers only. The government was eager to complete the work, it’s the farmers who got in the way. However, the MLA said that he has spoken with the irrigation officials over the matter of water shortage in the areas."
Military Digest | 40 years of Operation Meghdoot: How Indian Army took control of Siachen Glacier,Recalling the Indian Army's tremendous planning that ensured the Pakistan Army was taken by surprise and denied access to the Siachen Glacier as well as the key heights and passes surrounding it.,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/army-in-siachen.jpg?w=640,Indian Army troops deployed on Siachen Glacier. (Express photo),"Around 17 days before the Indian Army launched a preemptive operation to occupy certain heights located around Siachen Glacier, the top brass of HQs 15 Corps gathered in a war game at the headquarters in Srinagar to fine-tune the bold move. Exercise Walnut Cracker, as it was named, war-gamed the operational and logistical aspects of the eventually world-famous Operation Meghdoot.
On April 13 this year, the country will mark the 40th anniversary of Operation Meghdoot. While the actual operation and its fallout are well known to military enthusiasts and laymen, what is little known is the tremendous planning that ensured the Pakistan Army was taken by surprise and denied access to the Glacier as well as the key heights and passes surrounding it.
Also, the stellar role played by 4 Kumaon and 19 Kumaon must be mentioned whenever the story of the highest battlefield on earth is told.
Amit K Paul, the author of the book Meghdoot: The Beginning of the Coldest War, has written in detail about the occupation of Siachen Glacier and the preparations for it.
Writing for the Indian Defence Review, Paul says that among those who were present in the operations room of HQs 15 Corps on March 26, 1984, for the war game were the Northern Army Commander Lt Gen ML Chibber, Corps Commander Lt Gen PN Hoon and MGGS Northern Command Maj Gen Amarjit Singh.
GOC 3 Infantry Division Maj Gen Shiv Sharma, Commander 26 Sector Brig VN Channa, CO 19 Kumaon Lt Col DK Khanna and CO 1 Vikas Lt Col Pushkar Chand were part of the Blue Land Force in the war game, writes Paul.
Among the Red Land Force, denoting the enemy (Pakistan), were Commander 114 Infantry Brigade, Brigadier Moti Dhar, Col (Int) HQs 15 Corps, Colonel PK Jain, GSO 1 (Int) HQs 15 Corps, Lt Col MU Ali and CO 14 Dogra, Lt Col AK Budhiraja.
The opposing forces were tasked with occupying Bilafond La, Sia La and patrolling up to Indira Col. Indira Col is the northernmost point and has an altitude of 5,764 metres in the Siachen Muztagh in the Karakoram Range. There are two Cols present in this region. One is in the eastern region, and the other is in the western region. The American mountaineer Bullock Workman named Eastern Col Indira Col in 1912 as one of the names of the goddess Lakshmi.
Incidentally, Fanny Bullock Workman proposed in 1913 to name certain peaks on the Saltoro Range after King George, Queen Mary, and Lord Hardinge, but the Government of India and the Survey of India did not accept these names.
Paul writes that it was anticipated in the war game that Pakistan may react to the Indian pre-emptive strike by crossing the Saltoro Ridge, South of Bilafond La, and cutting off or interfering with the Indian line of maintenance to the forward-deployed troops. This threat was analysed and dismissed because of Pakistani troops near the area.
Eventually, Op Meghdoot worked like clockwork due to the meticulous planning done beforehand. Maj R S Sandhu and Captain Sanjay Kulkarni of 4 Kumaon, with one platoon, were dropped by helicopter about three kilometres short of Bilafond La on April 13. The pass was secured in the next few days, a delay caused by inclement weather. Sia La was occupied by April 17.
The Army record of Operation Meghdoot mentions that a foot column led by Capt PV Yadav reached the Glacier subsequently after an extremely strenuous four-day march over extremely inhospitable terrain. The column set up Camps I, II and III to maintain newly established posts on the Glacier.
In March 1984, another Kumaon Battalion earmarked for the operations in Siachen Glacier had accomplished a rare feat.
As per Army records, the entire unit moved on a man-pack basis, on foot during winter, from its permanent location in Khrew in Kashmir valley to the base of Siachen Glacier led by its CO, Lt Col DK Khanna.
After capturing Zojila in November 1948, it was the first and only time an Infantry battalion had marched across the snow-bound Zojila during winter.
This feat of 19 Kumaon was definitely a terrific example of grit, discipline, and mental toughness. Such a vast distance in the world’s toughest terrain, at such an altitude and forbidding climate, was covered on foot with complete battle loads."

"Gujarat Hardlook | How Surat’s Suman Schools are powering dreams, changing lives of low-income groups","The Surat Municipal Corporation was the first civic body to introduce Suman High Schools in multiple mediums to arrest dropout rates among underprivileged children. Twenty-five years after their establishment, the schools continue to stay relevant and play a key role, especially in a city with more than 40 per cent migrant population.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/suman-schools.jpg?w=640,Suman High Schools programme was introduced in 1999 to provide quality secondary education to the low-income group in Surat city with nominal fees. (Express File Photo),"Twenty-year-old Jagruti Patil’s father passed away 13 years ago. Her mother who works as a house help to run the family. She ensures that the family’s monetary circumstances do not affect her children’s education. Living up to her mother’s expectations, Jagruti topped Suman High School in Pandesara area of Surat last year in the Class 12 boards scoring 95.7 per cent and is now doing her B.Com from D. B. Bhana College at Vesu in Surat.
“My younger brother is now in Class 10 at Suman High School No 6 in Pandesara. My maternal uncle who runs an auto garage also stays close by and helps us when needed. I was not expecting such high marks, but my hard work and dedication paid off. I want to become an IAS or an IPS officer. My mother told me to fully concentrate on studies and not think about earning money,” Jagruti says. She starts her mornings by getting her brother ready for school and doing the household chores after which she sits to study.
Similarly, CA aspirant Siddhi Tarsariya has high aspirations. She is the youngest among the three children of Bharatbhai who works at a diamond factory in Surat. He earns around Rs 15,000 per month, while his wife and elder daughter supplement the family income by doing embellishments on sarees from home. The eldest is a son who works as a collection agent at a private bank. The family lets Siddhi to solely focus on her studies.
“My entire education was from the municipal school starting from Class I. Currently, I am taking coaching for Chartered Accountancy and have taken a scholarship for tuition fees from CA Ravi Chhawchharia. I have completed the foundation course in December 2023 and am now doing my intermediate course after which the CA Final will be the last hurdle,” says Siddhi who is also an external student of B.Com at Amroli college.
The 20-year-old plans to teach Chartered Accountancy after clearing the final.
First-year MBBS student Mayur Katariya is the son of diamond factory worker Nagjibhai — the sole breadwinner of the family of two children. Nearly two weeks ago, Mayur was invited by his alma mater, Suman High School at Punagam, to felicitate him and thus, inspire Class 12 students. “Due to my family’s poor financial condition, my parents got me admitted to the municipal school. Later, through our community leader, I got admission at a private school from where I did my Class 9 to Class 12. I gave scholarship exams at private schools and secured a seat,” he said.
Mayur scored 95 per cent and 81 per cent in Class 10 and Class 12 respectively, and cleared the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) scoring 620 to secure an MBBS admission at Government Medical College in Surat.
Mayur’s sister is a second-year commerce student, while his mother supplements the family income by decorating sarees.
Apart from their studious nature that powers their dreams, Jagruti, Siddhi and Mayur have another common link — all are alumni of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC)-run Suman (Surat Maha Nagar) schools.
Why Suman schools
The civic body introduced the Suman High Schools programme back in 1999 “to provide quality secondary education to the low-income group of the city with nominal fees”.
According to Suman Schools Administrator Dharmesh Patel, the schools were started to reduce “dropout rates” as a large number of students who passed out from the municipal board schools after class 8 struggled to get admission in class 9 self-financed or grant-in-aid schools. Thus, many would discontinue their studies. “In Suman schools, we give admission only to municipal school students. We have 23 schools with 182 classes for class 9 and 10 students and 17 schools with 57 classes for class 11 and 12 students,” Dharmesh said.
Back in 1999, classes were offered only in Gujarati medium. However, 25 years later, Marathi, Hindi, Odia, Urdu and English medium schools have also been established to keep up with the demands of the city’s high migrant population. Nearly 40 per cent are migrants in Surat’s population of 70 lakh.
According to Dharmesh, the school board has added Marathi medium schools on demand. “So, we started new classes for 11 and 12 Science streams. The school authorities are also planning to start Class 12 Science in Gujarati medium in the next academic session in 2025,” Dharmesh Patel said.
He added that there is a shortage of schools and classrooms. “On our request, SMC has added four new schools whose foundation stone was virtually laid by PM Narendra Modi during his recent visit to Navsari on February 22, 2024. The project will be finished by June 2025 and we will get 40 more classrooms,” he said.
For the longest time after it was established, Suman schools were only focused on secondary school education. That changed with the Covid-induced hardships.
In 2021, at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, when many parents were shifting their children from private schools to government-run schools, SMC former standing committee chairman Paresh Patel came up with the idea of launching classes 11 and 12 for Science and Commerce streams in Suman schools.
Currently a BJP councillor, Paresh Patel told The Indian Express that SMC sees education as a fundamental right of each and every child. “We noticed that students belonging to the low-income class were not enrolling themselves for secondary education after primary education. There might be many issues affecting their decision. Some may have to join private schools. Others may have to join grant-in-aid schools that are far from their residences. The dropout ratio increased as a result,” he said.
In 2022, Suman schools were started for Class 11 in general stream in the Gujarati, Marathi and Hindi mediums, and Science Stream in Marathi medium.
The first batch of students appeared in the Class 12 board exams in March 2023.
Last year, 10 students from various Suman high schools secured an A1 grade in Class 12 in the commerce stream. Four of these 10 were from the lower middle-class.
While 92 per cent commerce students cleared the exam, the pass percentage in the science stream was 75 per cent. The pass percentage of Class 10 board exam was 75 per cent last year.
“I was a bright student, and the Municipal teachers paid extra attention to me. They believed that I would do something great in future. In the municipal school, I learnt how to build a good character along with studies. The municipal schools are neat, clean and tidy, and even the teachers ensure that students come in neat and tidy uniforms,” Mayur Katariya said.
While education is absolutely free of cost for girls, boys are charged Rs 200 per year till class 10. For classes 11 and 12, the boys have to pay a one-time fee of Rs 1,000.
Suman vs Municipal board schools
SMC was the first civic body in Gujarat to run higher secondary schools. The civic body runs two school boards — the Municipal school board for students from classes 1 to 8, and the Suman High School board that runs secondary and higher secondary sections. The two boards are separate and function independently under the civic body. Different officials are deputed for the administration of both boards.
While Suman schools came into existence only 25 years ago, the Surat Municipal School Board was established in 1925 and runs 327 schools from classes 1-8 with a headcount of 1.71 lakh students across seven mediums — Gujarati, Hindi, Telugu, Marathi, Urdu, English and Odia.
Overall, 13,477 students (6,184 boys and 7,293 girls) from classes 9 to 12 study across 23 Suman schools in Gujarati, Marathi, Hindi, Odia, Urdu and English mediums. These include 2,730 students (1,116 boys and 1,614 girls) in Class 11 and Class 12 Commerce stream in Gujarati, Marathi and Hindi mediums across 49 classes. In the science stream, there are two classes with 103 students (43 boys and 60 girls).
This year, 5,338 students of the SMC-run higher secondary schools are sitting for class 10 and 12 board exams that commenced on March 11.
The state government annually sets aside Rs 900 crore — 80 per cent as grants — to run municipal schools till Class 8. For Suman schools, however, the funds are generated from various schemes of the state government and the budget increases around 10 per cent annually. The budget for the current year is at Rs 50 crore.
The uniforms at Suman and municipal schools are different. Both Suman and municipal schools are run on different, independent premises."
‘BJP is like a dinosaur that doesn’t know its tail is being crushed’: ex-vice president Mahila Morcha,"Today, the BJP has become like a big dinosaur that does not know its tail is being crushed... The message will take time to travel to the brain through the nervous system in this huge body.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Jyoti.jpg?w=640,"Jyoti Pandya, Former National Vice-President, BJP Mahila Morcha (Express File Photo)","Jyoti Pandya, the former national vice-president of the BJP’s Mahila Morcha, was last week suspended by the party minutes before she held a press conference to voice her dissent against the nomination of sitting MP Ranjan Bhatt for the third time in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections from Vadodara.
In an exclusive interview with The Indian Express, Pandya, who has worked for 38 years in the party in various capacities, speaks on an array of issues related to Vadodara and the BJP, while not ruling out the possibility of fighting the elections as an independent. Excerpts:
Was it an impulsive decision to quit or one that came after long distress?
The feeling came a while ago… I had started feeling bad when women in the party would come and share their stories where they had been insulted or treated harshly. The feeling of disenchantment also started growing when I would often visit Surat as election incharge for the civic body, Assembly or other polls and see the developments there.
These were the seeds in my mind… but the third term for Ranjan (Bhatt) was the trigger. The party had taken my biodata twice in one week and I was very calm and confident as 10 years (of Bhatt’s tenure) is a sufficient time to prove inefficiency… My question is, what makes you do that (field Bhatt for a third term)? If it is stree-hath (obstinacy of a woman), I can also have it.
Would you have quit if the candidate would have been someone else but you?
If not for her, and if anyone else would have been the candidate, I would not have quit. I was given Mayorship (December 2010 to mid-2013) in the normal course as I was educated, young, dynamic and was giving my complete time to the party… What makes you select someone who is not performing? There is no dearth of leaders in Vadodara. New faces are required to continue the party… If you keep repeating the same people, the younger generation will think, ‘What are we doing here in the party.’
The party makes even the lowest rung of party workers work hard 24×7. They have to attend the party phone call, setting aside everything. If you do not do it, you are out! I am ageing now… I want to be somewhere.
Whom did you first call in the party to inform about your decision?
I spoke to (CR) Paatil saheb and (BJP state general secretary) Ratnakarji. Both answered my calls… Paatil sent Vijay Shah (Vadodara city President) and Balu Shukla (MLA Raopura and BJP Chief Whip in the Assembly) to speak to me, but I knew they were there for formality and they did not really want me to stay back… Paatil is mature but he works to achieve what has been asked of him.
Why did you say that BJP leaders are scared to speak out?
Everyone is being insulted so badly that they are scared to speak. You have to fall in line or get suspended. The ideology of the party has been compromised with the defections that are bringing in new people.
Today, the BJP has become like a big dinosaur that does not know its tail is being crushed… The message will take time to travel to the brain through the nervous system in this huge body.
The BJP I started with was a conviction and ideology-based party that respected commitment. Today, you cannot be sure if the commitment will be valued and if the people who have joined in now will show commitment.
You spoke about lack of development in Vadodara during the two-terms under Ranjan Bhatt. What did you mean?
I was always keen on infrastructure development — drinking water and drainage lines mix often. There is a lack of coordination within VMC (Vadodara Municipal Corporation) departments — they lay a pipeline network right after constructing and repairing a road. We need an international airport in Vadodara, which has not happened. We have Anand district in close proximity that has lakhs of international travellers, who have to travel all the way to Ahmedabad although Vadodara is closer. Why have we lacked the vision to expedite the international airport and get more travellers from Vadodara? Vadodara lost AIIMS and then we say that SSG hospital is overloaded due to patients from MP and Rajasthan… So why did we not get AIIMS? The Central government is set to give everything but the leaders of the city should have the vision to ask.
BJP’s city unit is often accused of interfering in the VMC work. Does it hamper the work?
It is true that they interfere a lot… If it is required, then you do it; but if each party office-bearer starts giving instructions, how will they (VMC officers) follow everything? Even in our house, the domestic help is not instructed by every member. There is a lack of literacy among leaders but maturity can help a lot. But leaders lack vision and selflessness. They are only working for vested interests and power. There is no collective thinking.
The communication gap between the administrative officers and the elected leaders is a problem.
The BJP has been the ruling party in the state for the last three decades but it is the collective will of genuine local leaders (that brings development). I have been talking for the last two days and so these issues have come out for public discussion. I knew if I speak, I will get suspended and finished. But I want to come up with the truth so that the leadership hears it.
Isn’t it true that Vadodara and Central Gujarat lack representation in the state government that also affects development?
CR Paatil was in Vadodara (for the inauguration of the Vadodara district party office) and said it would be good if the local leaders should pay heed to demands for development but within seven hours, he burdened the heads of the unit with the same inefficient candidate who has not been able to show any significant work in her decade-long tenure and needs to be discarded. They think of Vadodara leaders as gajar-mooli (insignificant like carrots and radishes)… Everytime Paatil comes to Vadodara, he makes instigating statements and leaves party factions in antagonism.
What genuine leadership are you referring to?
What is the meaning of genuine leadership? It means perceiving the problems and giving the right solution. For that you need teamwork, communication and skills to understand the organisation and aspiration of people. This genuine leadership is lacking somewhere. We know that IAS officers are declining postings in Vadodara.
The officers are qualified and skilled but they can only work with someone who understands the scope as well as limitations of the system. At the same time, you have to work with a time limit. Only genuine leaders will know this.
What makes Vadodara vote for the BJP in polls despite lacking development?
There are many pseudo leaders and people are looking for genuine leadership. If they get it, they will vote for someone else. People trust only (Narendra) Modiji because he is a genuine leader and he made a promise to Vadodara when he chose to hold Varanasi as his constituency but he is sending such a person to Vadodara who has failed… People vote for Modiji because he keeps coming here to assure them that he is there.
Will you contest the polls as an independent?
There are chances, but at this moment, I cannot commit to anything. But the situation is changing every minute and many people are contacting me… It is a scary picture as without a party’s backing, how will I do (contest the polls)? But I have a desire and if I get a good network, I might contest. If the people of Vadodara tell me to do something, I will do it. Right now, I have 70 per cent of my mind to work hard and make it happen."

(Representational photo)","A division bench of the Allahabad High Court has set aside the suspension of a lecturer of a government college in Uttar Pradesh’s Mirzapur district on the charge that he contracted second marriage during the subsistence of his first marriage.
A bench comprising Justices Ashwani Kumar Mishra and Syed Qamar Hasan Rizvi, while upholding a single-judge order, noted that once the jurisdiction was invoked to award “minor” punishment, it was impermissible to place the employee under suspension, and the requirements of inquiry and opportunity of hearing were not met.
A minor punishment could have been imposed upon the employee only if the employer was satisfied with the existence of charges levelled against the employee concerned, it observed.
The bench dismissed a special appeal filed by the Uttar Pradesh state challenging the order of a single judge who had set aside the suspension of Bhaskar Prasad Dwivedi, lecturer of Sanskrit at the Government Degree College, Chunar, in Mirzapur district.
The bench in its decision dated March 11 said, “For exercising such power like minor penalty, the state government will have to inform the delinquent employee on the substance of imputations against him and call upon him to submit an explanation within a reasonable time.” “Once the jurisdiction was invoked to award minor punishment, it was impermissible to place the employee under suspension in as much as suspension would be permissible only where minor punishment can be awarded in view of Rule 4 of the Government employees discipline and appeal Rules, 1999, which provides enquiry and opportunity of hearing before taking any action against the employee”.
Both requirements were not met in the present case, it said.
Earlier, the single-judge bench had set aside the order passed by the state government on July 27, 2023.
The single-judge bench had taken note of the fact that there was no enquiry report in existence based on which the employer decided to impose minor punishment.
According to the single bench, the minor punishment under Rule 10 of the Rules could have been imposed upon the employee only if the employee was satisfied about the existence of charges levelled against the employee concerned.
According to the rules, the suspension should not be resorted to unless the allegations against the government servant are so serious that in the event of it being established may ordinarily warrant a major penalty."

(PTI File Photo),"Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin on Tuesday dismissed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act as ‘divisive and bereft of any use’ and asserted that it will not be implemented in the state.
Hitting out at the BJP regime at the Centre for notifying the rules for implementing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) ‘in a haste’ when the Lok Sabha polls are round the corner, Stalin said the CAA and its rules went against the basic structure of the Constitution.
“There is not going to be any use or benefits due to the CAA, which only paves the way for creating divisions among the Indian people. The stand of the government is that this law is completely unwarranted; it is one that must be repealed.” Hence, “the Tamil Nadu government will not give any opportunity in any manner to implement the CAA in Tamil Nadu,” he asserted in an official release.
Stalin, also president of the ruling DMK, reiterated that the CAA went against pluralism, secularism, minority communities and the Sri Lankan Tamil refugees."
"BJP’s Khushbu asks whether Tamil women will vote for DMK in return for ‘Rs 1,000 alms’, kicks up a row","Khushbu Sundar was criticising the Tamil Nadu government’s flagship programme of giving Rs 1,000 monthly to women heads of the family; DMK slams Khushbu for lowering the dignity of Tamil women.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/khusbhu.jpg?w=640,Actress-turned politician Khushbu Sundar (X/Khushbu),"Actress-turned politician Khushbu Sundar has found herself in the middle of a controversy over her comments about the Tamil Nadu government’s flagship programme of giving Rs 1,000 monthly to women heads of the family.
“Will women vote for them if they are given Rs 1,000 as alms? If DMK eradicates the drug menace and shuts down Tasmac then people would not need to resort to seeking Rs 1,000 alms,” Khushbu, also a member of the National Commission for Women, said while addressing a BJP rally in Chennai on Monday.
However, the comments by Khushbu, who is the BJP’s probable candidate from Central Chennai, has triggered strong reactions from the ruling DMK. The DMK members on social media slammed Khushbu for lowering the dignity of Tamil women by equating them to those who beg for a living.
“It’s not something new for Khushbhu to slander common public .The party she belongs works that way,” Padma Priya, state deputy secretary of DMK IT wing, noted.
Khushbu, also a member of BJP’s national executive committee, accused Chief Minister M K Stalin of not taking any measure to address narcotics trafficking in the state even after the arrest of drug kingpin A R Jaffer Sadiq, who was previously a DMK functionary, a few days ago.
Jaffar was accused of being the kingpin in a Rs 2,000-crore international drug trafficking racket in Delhi. He was later expelled from DMK’s primary membership.
Khushbu said the DMK’s only focus is on acquiring more wealth for the welfare of its family members. She slammed the DMK government for allegedly cheating the people of the state with their Rs 1,000 financial assistance scheme to women.
She further added that many from Congress are making their way to BJP as they have realised that BJP is the only political organisation which is capable of doing welfare to the nation and Narendra Modi is the best leader in the globe.
As Khushbhu’s speech began to be shared widely on social media, she took to X to justify her comments on Tamil women. She said DMK needs Khushbu to stay afloat in the news and all she said in her speech was to control the drug menace.
She claimed that no one condemned former union minister Murasoli Maran’s statement when he commented in 1982 that free meals to the poor provided by then Chief Minister MG Ramachandran was a pitchai (alms) thrown at them. She also cited examples of DMK leaders like K Ponmudi and EV Velu making objectionable remarks against women and the people of the state.
“All of you were blind, mute and deaf then? All I say is stop drug menace, cut your commission from tasmac,” she said.
Further, she added that the amount of pain the women go through by drunken men is much more than the government’s share of income from state-owned Tasmac."

While the CPI will retain both the seats – Nagapattinam and Tiruppur – contested in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the CPI(M) will contest from Madurai, which it won in the 2019 election, and also Dindigul.
After meeting Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin, CPI(M) state secretary K Balakrishnan told reporters at the DMK headquarters that after the seat-sharing agreement reached two weeks ago, the parties have been holding discussions for the past few days to zero in on the constituencies they wished to contest and it was finally finalised on Tuesday.
“The DMK-led Secular Progressive Front (SPF) which is part of the INDIA alliance, has begun the election work. We have reached an agreement. We will contest from Madurai and Dindigul. Not just these two constituencies, we are confident that our alliance will emerge victorious in all 40 constituencies in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry,” he said.
When asked about the reason behind the DMK not allocating the Coimbatore seat to CPI(M), which they had previously won in 2019, Balakrishnan said both the parties have exchanged their sitting seats through a consensus.
R Mutharasan of CPI, who also met Stalin, told reporters that the INDIA alliance was formed to fight against the fascist and autocratic rule of BJP and save democracy and uphold secularism.
He noted that contrary to the expectations of a few people who anticipated a split in the DMK-led alliance, hoping to gain political advantage from it, the DMK has successfully completed the seat-sharing talks with its allies in a smooth manner.
The DMK-led alliance for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls comprises Congress, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK), Communist Party of India (CPI), Communist Party of India(Marxist), Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK), Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) and Kongunadu Makkal Desiya Katchi (KMDK).
Actor Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM), the latest to join the alliance, has been provided a Rajya Sabha seat and it was agreed that Haasan’s party will not contest the Lok Sabha elections but will campaign for DMK-led alliance across Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.
As per the seat-sharing agreement between the alliance parties, Congress will contest in 9 seats in Tamil Nadu and one in Puducherry, while VCK, and Left parties were allocated two seats each. The rest of the parties, including MDMK, IUML and KMDK were allotted one seat each, while the DMK will field candidates directly in 21 seats."

“The BJP will definitely form the government. Everyone knows that Narendra Modi will become the prime minister again. The AMMK will work like a squirrel to help the BJP emerge victorious in Tamil Nadu as well,” he said.
Commenting on the seat-sharing talks, Dhinakaran said an announcement would be made later. He added that the BJP did not pressurise them to contest on their ‘lotus symbol’ and AMMK candidates will contest on a separate symbol.
When asked whether he would contest in the upcoming polls, Dhinakaran said he has not taken a decision yet.
While replying to a question on whether the BJP has a secular ideology, the AMMK leader said, “The BJP may have an ideology that you and I may not agree with, but as far as I am concerned, the BJP is required in today’s time for India’s growth.”
The AMMK contested the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in alliance with the Social Democratic Party of India and drew a blank."

"Days after calling Modi ‘bada bhai’, Revanth Reddy stung by PM’s attack: ‘Unbecoming to criticise state govt’","Speaking to media persons later, Reddy said, “It is unbecoming of Modi to criticise the state government. Modi insulted Telangana and has no right to utter even a single word on Telangana.”",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/modi-14.jpg?w=640,Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Telangana Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy in Telangana. (PTI Photo),"Telangana Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy, who recently referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as “bade bhai”, was livid as the PM targeted the Congress in the state. Modi, who is on a two-day tour of Telangana, while addressing a public meeting at Nagarkurnool Saturday morning, said that after the “maha loot” by the Bharat Rashtra Samiti, the “buri nazar” of Congress would destroy Telangana.
“Congress and BRS together have shattered every dream of development in Telangana. And now, the difficulty is that here, the Congress’s grip has tightened. First, the plunder by the BRS, and now, the evil eye of the Congress. It’s like falling from a well into a pit. For the Congress, even 5 years are enough to ruin the entire state,” Modi said.
Speaking to media persons later, Reddy said, “It is unbecoming of Modi to criticise the state government. Modi insulted Telangana and has no right to utter even a single word on Telangana.”
Earlier this month, on March 4, Reddy flew to Adilabad to welcome Modi, who had arrived to dedicate to the nation several development projects and lay the foundation stone for some new projects. Addressing Modi at an event there, Revanth, speaking in Hindi, referred to him as “bada bhai (elder brother)” while seeking support from the Centre to develop Telangana. “Hamare hisaab se Pradhan Mantri matlab bade bhai (According to us, Prime Minister means elder brother),” Revanth had said.
Reacting to the arrest of Bharat Rashtra Samiti MLC K Kavitha by the Enforcement Directorate a day earlier, Reddy said it was a drama being played by BRS and BJP. “Kavitha was arrested 24 hours before the Election Commission issued notification. The arrest is an election stunt. BRS is eyeing to gain sympathy votes from Kavitha’s arrest while BJP wants votes by taking credit for her arrest,” he said.
“K Chandrashekar Rao has not condemned the arrest and also no statement is released on his daughter’s arrest so far. What does KCR’s silence signify? Modi and ED arrived in Hyderabad the same day. BRS and BJP are staging political dramas only to damage the Congress politically. What is the strategy behind the silence of KCR and Modi? Telangana is watching the political drama,” he said.
He also said he worked hard in the 100 days since he took over as CM of the state. “Our government created history by filling 30,000 government jobs in three months. It has instilled confidence among the unemployed youth. Steps have been taken to disburse salaries to government employees on the first day of every month,” he said."

Industry insiders say it is Krishna Reddy’s enterprise and bold strategies that turned the small company into an industrial conglomerate, executing projects in over 20 states as well as abroad. As head of one of the largest companies with years of experience in executing mega projects, he was known to chief ministers of both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.
In 2016, the Telangana Government awarded contracts to construct several phases of the massive Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project, which cost over Rs 1 lakh crore. When the BRS was in power, A Revanth Reddy, who was then in the opposition and is now the CM, repeatedly accused the government as well as MEIL of indulging in corruption and siphoning off crores from the project.
The Chief Minister has now constituted a judicial commission to probe alleged irregularities in the project, the majority of which was executed by the MEIL.
In Andhra Pradesh, when Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy was in the opposition from 2014 to 2019, he had accused MEIL, when it was awarded the Pattiseema irrigation project by then CM N Chandrababu Naidu, of corruption. However, in 2019, after Jagan came to power, he cancelled the contract with Navayuga Engineering to construct portions of the Polavaram Project, and awarded it to MEIL.
In October 2019, Income Tax authorities searched the premises of MEIL on suspicion of tax evasion. In August 2020, MEIL won the Rs 4,509-crore contract to construct Zojila tunnel.
In the past four years, MEIL has also waded into the media industry by teaming up with Hyderabad-based My Home Group and acquiring TV9 Telugu channel, and purchasing 22 per cent stake in NTV Telugu channel. The company has also ventured into manufacturing large electric vehicles – in 2000, MEIL launched Olectra Greentech Limited to manufacture e-buses and trucks."

According to the police, the woman was trolled by the accused for praising Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy.
Police have also arrested another man allegedly associated with the Jana Sena Party (JSP).
On March 4, Gothi Geetanjali (32) of Tenali in Guntur district and a beneficiary of the YSRCP government’s plot allotment scheme – the Jagananna Housing Scheme – had praised Chief Minister Reddy while speaking to a TV channel after receiving a plot of land.
The YSRCP had used a video clip of her and declared her a “star campaigner” for Jagan. As the video went viral, several persons allegedly associated with the TDP and JSP posted objectionable comments about the woman.
On March 7, Geetanjali jumped in front of the Janmabhoomi Express near Tenali Railway Station and died at a hospital four days later. Her husband G Balachander and other family members alleged she was upset after getting trolled. “They maligned her reputation,” Balchander said.
Police registered a case under IPC section 306 (abetment to suicide) against several persons allegedly operating the social media accounts. “We have identified a few social media profiles which are handled by actual owners and a few fake accounts, and we will ensure we trace them and take necessary action. The language used by some of the trolls is highly objectionable and her family members say she felt humiliated and insulted and it drove her to take the extreme step,” said Tushar Dudi, the Guntur Superintendent of Police.
Chief Minister Reddy announced Rs 20 lakh as compensation to her family.

(File Photo)","The Hyderabad Police on Wednesday arrested a suspended Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) who is suspected of having tapped the phones of the Bharat Rashtra Samiti’s (BRS) political opponents while the party was in power in Telangana.
DSP Dugyala Praneeth Kumar had been posted with the Special Intelligence Bureau (SIB) when the alleged offences took place. He was suspended earlier this month after it came to light that he allegedly erased intelligence data from the SIB’s hard drives after Congress won the Assembly election last year.
He is also accused of having copied intelligence data to his personal devices. He was booked last week on charges of tampering with evidence, breach of trust, and criminal conspiracy.
Kumar was taken into custody on Tuesday night and arrested on Wednesday following questioning overnight, officials said.
According to sources, Kumar is suspected of having been involved in the tapping of phones of Opposition leaders and others when the BRS was in power. SIB Additional Superintendent of Police D Ramesh had lodged the first complaint against Kumar after finding that he was involved in the alleged phone tapping and copying of data between 2018 and 2023.
Kumar regularly copied intelligence data onto his personal pen drives, and is suspected of using the official intelligence-gathering machinery to profile several people, including the BRS’s opponents, officials said.
After the Congress came to power in December last year following the BRS’s defeat in Assembly elections, he allegedly tried to destroy evidence of these activities.
According to the complaint against him, Kumar entered his office on the night of December 4, a day after the counting of votes in the Assembly election ended, and switched off all the CCTV cameras before destroying the hard drives and other disks that contained intelligence data collected over many years. He then allegedly installed new, blank hard drives.
After this came to light, the Congress government transferred him to Sircilla district and asked senior SIB officers to conduct a probe.
An FIR has been registered against him at the Panjagutta police station in Hyderabad. He was booked under Indian Penal Code sections 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, banker, merchant or agent), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupee or upwards), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence), and 120(B) (criminal conspiracy). He was also booked under various sections of the Prevention of Destruction of Public Records Act, 1984, and the Information Technology Act, 2000."

This was in response to reports that Biocon had donated to Janata Dal (Secular) through electoral bonds in Karnataka.
In a post on X, Shaw wrote: “Would like to clarify that Biocon did not make any political donation to JDS or any other party for elections. At a personal level I purchased electoral bonds which I donated to JDS and several parties”.
She said her “donations were nominal on the principle of funding election campaigns with white money.”

The submissions made by the JD(S) to Election Commission last year showed that Biocon Limited had donated thrice to the party, totalling Rs 2.5 crore, since 2018.
The JD(S) is among the few parties in the country that have shared their donors’ list. Megha Engineering and Infrastructures Limited (MEIL) contributed Rs 50 crore of the Rs 89.75 crore the JD(S) received through electoral bonds.
Data on electoral bonds released by the Election Commission showed that Shaw donated Rs 6 crore on April 10, 2023, a month before the Assembly elections in Karnataka. On March 15, she was involved in an argument on X after a user pointed out her donations in the list. When questioned whether she was “asked” to donate, she stated that “all parties want funding”.

Over half of JD(S)’s electoral bond donations came from Megha Engineering,"According to the details submitted to the Election Commission of India by H D Deve Gowda, national president of the JD(S), electoral bond donations from MEIL amounted to Rs 50 crore – nearly 56 per cent of total received by the party.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/hd-deve-gowda.jpg?w=640,JD(S) president and former PM H D Deve Gowda. (Photo: Janata Dal Secular/ X),"Janata Dal (Secular), which was among the parties to have disclosed the identity of their electoral bond donors, received more than half of its total Rs 89.75-crore donations from Hyderabad-based Megha Engineering and Infrastructures Ltd (MEIL).
According to the details submitted to the Election Commission of India by H D Deve Gowda, national president of the JD(S), electoral bond donations from MEIL amounted to Rs 50 crore – nearly 56 per cent of total received by the party.
Run by Krishna Reddy, MEIL is involved in marquee projects of the Telangana government such as the Kaleswaram Dam project. In total, the company and its subsidiaries have spent more than Rs 1,200 crore on electoral bonds between April 2019 and November 2023, as per data released by the Election Commission. This makes it the second-largest purchaser of electoral bonds.
In October 2019, the Income Tax department raided the offices of the company. Following this, a probe was also initiated by the Enforcement Directorate. On April 12 that year alone, MEIL had purchased bonds worth Rs 50 crore. In March 2019, it had donated bonds worth Rs 10 crore to JD(S); it also donated Rs 40 crore via poll bonds to the JD(S) in 2023.
While MEIL was the biggest donor to the JD(S), which has aligned with the BJP in Karnataka to fight the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, the second-largest donor to the party was the Embassy Group of Companies, which donated Rs 22 crore. All the bonds from the Embassy Group were received by the JD(S) in 2018 – Rs 3 crore in March, Rs 7 crore in April and Rs 10 crore in May, two days after the announcement of the 2018 election results that led to a hung Assembly.
The Embassy Group is headed by Jitendra Mohandas Virwani, a major builder and realtor in Bengaluru. He has developed several prominent properties in the city and partnered K J George, currently Karnataka’s Energy minister, in the development of the Embassy Golf Links – one of the most prominent tech parks in the city.
The group also faced raids by the Income Tax Department in June 2022.
JSW Steel was another major donor to the JD(S), donating electoral bonds worth Rs 5 crore in three payments in 2019, between April 6 and 11. JSW runs a steel unit at Ballari and was at the centre of a controversy over the state government’s plan to sell 3,667 acres of land to the firm. In 2019, when the JD(S)’s H D Kumaraswamy was Karnataka chief minister, the state government had agreed to sell the land, but the sale was put on hold amid legal and political opposition to the move. Two years later, the BJP government under B S Yediyurappa had also decided to sell the land to the firm, but that plan was also later shelved.
Other major electoral bond donors to the JD(S) include Shankaranarayana Constructions (P) Ltd (donated Rs 5 crore), Biocon (Rs 2.5 crore), Amar Raj Groups (Rs 2 crore), Shahi Exports (Rs 1.5 crore), and Infosys Technologies Ltd (Rs 1 crore)."
"Know Your City: Turahalli forest, Bengaluru’s last patch of wilderness","Located on the southwestern edge of Bengaluru, Turahalli is a deciduous shrub forest.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Turahalli-forest.jpg?w=640,The large rock formations in the area have made Turahalli popular with rock climbers in the Minor Forest area.,"Bengaluru has long been proud of its green spaces, with age-old gardens such as Lalbagh Botanical Garden and Cubbon Park. Even with the encroachment of modernity, some of these remain.
However, as far as true forests are concerned, one of the last pieces of nature that can claim that title survives is over several hundred acres of land near the southwestern edge of the city. The modern Turahalli forest, which was notified before Independence, is a somewhat fractured version of a larger forest that covered the area.
Wildlife activist and former State Wildlife Board member Joseph Hoover explains, “Now we have the Turahalli Reserve Forest, the Turahalli State Forest and the Turahalli Minor Forest”.
The Turahalli forest in its natural state is a deciduous shrub forest, in keeping with the dry climate of the area. According to Hoover, while it was once home to a population of the endangered Indian wolf, leopards can be occasionally seen in the area.
Also present are the typical fauna for this type of forest including spotted deer, along with a high density of bird life. However, Hoover notes the deer population here comes under attack from stray dog packs who hunt them, and foreign species of plants and trees such as Eucalyptus and acacia have a large presence in the Turahalli forest as well.
The large rock formations in the area have made Turahalli popular with rock climbers in the Minor Forest area. Along with cycling, these activities have since been restricted, especially post-quarantine.
Noting the challenges facing the forest, Hoover said, “Many places have been taken over and encroached. People dump debris and garbage in the area… Every year fire is an issue…about 15 days ago I had alerted the Forest Department to one and it was put out”.
Hoover noted that some goat herders in the area would burn dry grass in the forest in the hope of it being replaced by fresh grass for their animals, which could result in more forest fires.
Locals and activists alike have also pointed out that enforcement of measures against these various issues by the Forest Department is hampered by the fact the department is generally quite understaffed in comparison to the work that has to be done.
Of late, however, residents have been raising more awareness regarding the challenges facing Turahalli.
Recalling protests by residents against plans for a tree park, Arun of Changemakers Kanakapura said, “We along with other residents and groups spoke to the forest officials about it along with wildlife activists. Because with a tree park, you will eventually have a lot more movement of people as well as commercial activity”.
In the end, the plans were shelved."
Guide to buying used tablet in India: A 4-step checklist,Planning to buy a refurbished tablet? Here are some things you should look out for before spending your hard earned money.,https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Used-tablet-buying-guide.jpg?w=640,Refurbished tablets can help you save a lot of money. (Express Photo),"Tablets are great for both work and play, covering the middle ground between smartphones and laptops. For those on a budget or looking for a deal that offers great value for money, buying a used tablet might be better than purchasing a new one. If you are thinking about buying a refurbished tablet, here are some things you should look out for.
One of the most important things when buying a used or refurbished product is to check it for physical damage and ensure that it is in good condition. Since tablets have huge screens, the first thing to inspect is the display.
While minor scratches won’t have any effect on functionality if the previous owner has installed a screen protector, if you spot a crack, ask them to remove it to check if the glass is cracked or if it is just the protector.
If the tablet is in a cover, remove it and check the back panel and the corners for any dents, deformations or scratches.
Buying a refurbished tablet instead of a new one will save you a ton of money, but before you do, make sure the model you purchase packs the hardware you intend to use it for.
You can do so by checking reviews of the tablet online, manually determining if the screen is crisp and bright enough for your needs and checking the software support from the manufacturer’s website.
Also, make sure that the tablet has been factory reset before you purchase it. Some tablets may still ask for the previous owner’s password, so if you are buying it from someone, make sure you remove that and set your password.
Before you decide to buy a second-hand tablet, make sure you have checked the device for hardware defects. If the tablet you are going to buy has an AMOLED screen, download an app to see if it has any dead pixels or burn-in. While spotting dead pixels may require a third-party app, screen burn-ins are pretty easy to spot.
Another thing to check is if the speakers are fine and working. Before purchasing the device, try to play music at the highest volume to see if the audio is cracking. If it is, chances are pretty high that the speakers are damaged. Most modern tablets come with a front and rear camera, so when purchasing a used one, open the camera app to check for any defects.
Tablets typically have an all-day battery life, but older ones may have a degraded battery that will barely last a day. If you are buying from an individual, you can ask them how long the battery lasts for them, but those purchasing from an online platform or seller should reach out to the refurbisher to learn more about the battery health.
Some tablets may have a loose or damaged charging port, so make sure you check it by inserting the charging cable and checking if the connector is working without a problem.
If you are purchasing the device from an online seller or a store that sells refurbished devices, make sure they either have a return policy or offer at least three to six months of warranty after making the purchase.
In most cases, this may not be as useful, but some hardware and software problems may take a few days to appear, so make sure you can return or ask the seller to repair the device in case it is acting up.

Qualcomm introduces Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 with on-device generative AI capabilities,"The Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 processor boasts support for large language models and on-device AI models with up to 10 billion parameters, enabling features like generative AI assistants, on-device image generation, and enhanced camera experiences.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/snapdragon-8s-gen3.jpg?w=640,Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 supports ray tracing (Image credit: Qualcomm),"Qualcomm on Monday announced its latest and the first “8s” series flagship mobile platform — the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3, intending to enable on-device generative AI capabilities on more Android smartphones. Major Android OEMs like Honor, iQOO, realme, Redmi, and Xiaomi are confirmed to launch Snapdragon 8s Gen 3-powered smartphones in the coming weeks.
The key highlights of the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 include the support of major large language models such as Baichuan-7B, Llama 2, and Google’s Gemini Nano, and the processor is capable of handling on-device AI models with up to 10 billion parameters.
“With capabilities including on-device generative AI and advanced photography features, Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 is designed to enhance user experiences, fostering creativity and productivity in their daily lives,” said Chris Patrick, senior vice president and general manager of mobile handsets, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.
The on-device AI engine can handle tasks like generative-AI-powered virtual assistant, image generation, and it also has multi-modal gen-AI model support. Smartphones powered by the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 processor can also offer experiences like on-device photo expansion, and the AI also powers the camera capabilities, powered by the 18-bit triple cognitive ISP.
The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 is an octa-core processor with one prime core clocked at 3GHz, four performance cores with a 2.8GHz clock speed, and three efficiency cores with up to 2GHz clock speed. The processor is fabbed using TSMC’s 4nm process and it also comes with the latest Adreno GPU.
The key differences between the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 can be limited to the CPU clock speed, networking capabilities, graphics, and AI capabilities. Qualcomm also confirmed that the graphics performance of the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 sits between the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. While the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 supports real-time hardware-accelerated ray tracing, it does not support Global illumination like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.
The Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 comes with the Snapdragon X70 5G Modem-RF System with up to 5Gbps downlink speed. The chip does support Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4. The processor can handle a display with up to 4K resolution at 60fps or a 2K resolution display with up to 144Hz.
It also supports up to 200 MP cameras; however, there is no 8K video recording capability, and it offers up to 4K 60fps HDR video recording. There is fast UFS 4.0 support along with up to 24 GB of LP-DDR5x RAM with up to 4200 MHz.

"The MacBook Air (M3) is ready for the ‘AI era’, but what you do with it matters the most","The 13-inch MacBook Air M3 is fantastic for web browsing, working on documents, entertainment and light photo and video editing.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/apple-macbook-air-m3-review.jpg?w=640,The new MacBook Air M3 is made for everyday computing. (Image credit: Anuj Bhatia/Indian Express),"Apple has added to all the confusion around AI PCs by pitching the new M3 MacBook Air as the “World’s Best Consumer Laptop for AI.” Yep, another computer with “AI” sprinkled on top of the messaging. But the truth is, the full picture will be revealed only when the company reveals its Gen AI strategy later this year, as CEO Tim Cook has already indicated. That means this notebook is now more of an AI-ready computer that may not give you exactly the true scale at which Apple sees how generative artificial intelligence will be embedded across its operating system or services.
So, should you get the new M3 MacBook Air just on the premise of it being a computer almost ready for the prime-time AI era, or do you want to upgrade to a Mac as a replacement for an old notebook that seems outdated both in tech and performance? I know, it won’t be an easy choice to make, but I hope my review will simplify your buying decision and help you choose the right Mac notebook for your needs. Here’s my take on the new M3 MacBook Air, which I have had for a week.
On an average day, I use my MacBook Air more than my iPhone. It’s the one device I use for everything from banking, creative work, entertainment, to online shopping. I have made a clear distinction between the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. And because of the MacBook Air’s design and smaller footprint, I use the device more often than I should be using a laptop on a regular day. During a workday that starts early in the morning, I find and distribute copies for my team members, and then I open my mail and respond to pending emails. Once I have breakfast, I open the Notes app on the Mac and write down the tasks I need to achieve. With copies from team members in my mail, I open Google Docs and edit them. I also use the Calendar app on the Mac to look for my appointments of the day. From there, my day actually starts, which involves a lot of writing and attending calls. Before I go to bed, I always listen to one or two podcasts or watch a documentary. At home, I use other devices a lot, like my iPhone for accessing WhatsApp or LinkedIn.
However, my Mac remains a central part of my digital life. In fact, at weekends, I test new apps or play games on the Mac. This has become a regular thing in the past few months.
Its size was the biggest draw for me, and I’m sure it’s the same for most people. I travel a lot – it’s the demand of my job, which makes it even more critical that I choose the lightest notebook possible that also meets my needs. Coming from a 16-inch MacBook Pro M3 Max (review) (which I still use and have no plans to give up anytime soon), the MacBook Air felt like a much different device. Just walking and travelling with the MacBook Air made so much difference. It is damned light, and you forget it’s there in your bag. With the MacBook Pro, which is not only heavier but also has a larger footprint overall, I struggle a lot with working on it on the plane. However, the MacBook Air allows me to write and edit copies on the plane or watch a movie while waiting to catch a flight in the airport lounge.
So just think about it. I can now take the MacBook Air on extended trips and still have the power of macOS and processing chops while also carrying my Nintendo Switch and Boom 3 portable speaker in the backpack. It’s a reminder that the reduced weight and smaller footprint of a laptop make a huge change in the life of a journalist like mine who is always on the go. More than the weight, I’d say the fact that I can grab the MacBook Air and work anywhere, in a cafe, take it to launch events, or in a park and write a piece with utmost silence gives a fresh perspective on using a computer. I am not a desk person, and now you know why I like the MacBook Air so much.
The MacBook Air is a gorgeous laptop, and I’m pretty sure people will notice it. A lot of my colleagues asked me about the new MBA when I brought it to the office. This notebook has a character of its own. Gone is the wedge-like design that made the MacBook Air a lot thicker toward the hinge of the screen. Instead, the M3 MacBook Air (as also seen on the M2 MacBook Air) has a wedgeless design. The M3 version has more rounded edges when the screen lid is closed. The design language is introduced to give continuity across all new Apple products. On my lap, on the couch, or on the desk, the device feels right.
The starlight colour variant, the one I got for review, is not only visually appealing but is also less of a fingerprint magnet. I had zero issues with the MacBook Air. The design, fit and finish, and build quality are impressive. I am glad that Apple maintains the same design ethos across all of its products, no matter if the device commands an extremely high price or falls into the entry-level category.
The M3 MacBook Air has two Thunderbolt Ports and MagSafe on the left, and a headphone jack on the laptop’s right side. The port situation is perfect for new-age average consumers who use cloud-based services like Google Drive to save their data. I know a lot of people don’t use SD cards or HDMI ports, and Apple was right about eliminating all of the extra ports and making room for a notebook that looks and feels lightweight. However, those who regularly use a USB-A port (in fact, people still use pen drives a lot in India) may be disappointed to find no USB-A port on the MacBook Air.
The M3 MacBook Air finally supports two external displays with the laptop closed. Previously, M1 and M2 Airs could only use one, and the lid had to be open. So, this may seem like a small change, but I feel it’s a significant boost, and users will appreciate the add-on, especially those who work in a hybrid setup.
Despite a compact footprint, the M3 MacBook Air still has the same Magic Keyboard, Touch ID and a set of full-height function keys as the 16-inch MacBook Pro M3 Max. The keyboard is so much joy to type on; the keys are responsive, allowing for smooth and accurate typing.
The 1080p webcam is way better than that on older MacBooks and matches the quality of the MacBook Pro. Additionally, the 13.6-inch display is an ideal size for daily writing, reading the e-paper of the Indian Express, watching movies, and even playing games. I feel the 13.6-inch display is the right size for tasks I’d like to do on a laptop, such as taking notes or spending hours on Pinterest. For those who want a bigger display, I think the 15-inch MacBook Air may be a better option. However, if you are a pro-consumer, I think the 14-inch MacBook Pro is something you should check out as it comes with a brighter MiniLED panel and 120Hz ProMotion display.
Ideally, the M3 MacBook Air will be fine for most consumers; its display is bright and vibrant and comes with 500 nits of brightness and improved P3 colour over the Intel MacBook Airs. Even the speaker quality on the MacBook Air is fantastic, given how thin this laptop is. Sure, they are not at the same level as my 16-inch MacBook Pro, which has six built-in speakers. Of course, the MacBook Pro speakers are loud and expansive as if the sound is coming from a HomePod mini. But for the size, the MacBook Air has excellent sound quality. Anyway, I use my AirPods most of the time when I am working or chilling.
I had been testing the top-end version of the 13.6-inch M3 MacBook Air for a week. It comes with an 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 512GB of SSD, and 16GB of RAM. One of the things that pleasantly surprised me about the M3 MacBook Air is the speed improvement. The 16GB of RAM, instead of 8GB, makes a difference. However, I would like to add that the change will be most visible if you are coming from an Intel-powered MacBook Air or M1 MBA. While 8GB RAM will be sufficient for most tasks people do on a computer, I personally opt for the 16GB RAM, given I need a machine that lasts for at least 5 years at a minimum. Anyway, the M3 is an excellent upgrade over the M1 and previous Intel versions, but the performance jump from M2 isn’t drastic except for a few changes. My M3 MacBook Air handled heavy tasks like multitasking with multiple tabs open or performing light video editing.
In my day-to-day use, I never felt the laptop was taxed. But again, it all depends on the tasks you perform on a computer. If you’re an Adobe Creative Cloud user, get an M3 MacBook Air. The apps run like a dream on a MacBook Air M3. Frankly, if you are someone who is an independent writer but also records and edits podcasts, I would easily recommend getting the M3 MacBook Air. This is a laptop for people who are in creative fields. Period.
Because of the excellent CPU performance, including graphical upgrades, the M3 MacBook Air supports hardware-accelerated mesh shading and ray tracing, which offers more accurate lighting, reflections, and shadows in video games. Games optimised for the Mac, such as Death Stranding: Director’s Cut, which I played, ran flawlessly on the M3 MacBook Air, though the 16-inch MacBook Pro M3 Max is better equipped to handle AAA games. I couldn’t believe I played a AAA game on a Mac, which I previously couldn’t. It’s still early days as far as gaming on Mac is concerned, but I am glad that Apple has finally acknowledged the gaming potential on a Mac after years of silence.
Perhaps for me, a make-or-break moment for any laptop is the battery life. I am okay to settle for one less USB-C port but can’t compromise on the battery life. Thankfully, the MacBook Air M3 has the best battery life I’ve tested on a lightweight laptop in years. Although Apple claims the MacBook Air M3 laptop can last up to 18 hours, I got 15 hours and 12 minutes of juice. The only laptop that lasts even longer is my 16-inch MacBook Pro M3 Max, but that laptop is way heavier.
When Apple pitches its M3 MacBook Air as an AI laptop, one needs to take it seriously. AI is everywhere in your phone, apps, and now laptop. I still don’t fully understand what is meant by “AI” in a notebook, especially when Apple has been using AI and machine learning in its devices for many years. I think AI could define the Mac in the months to come and become a meaningful part of the experience. As of now, the aspect of AI that truly redefines the Mac is not there. I am sure Apple wants to run Generative AI right on the Mac rather than on servers, which is how ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot get all the power. I tried FreeChat, a Mac-based chatbot which shows the potential of On-device Gen AI but the question lingers on how well Apple optimises Gen AI and morphs it into the core Mac experience.
I have fallen in love with the M3 MacBook Air, not only because of the promise of future AI but due to its sheer portability. Its fanless design, excellent performance, long battery life, and sexy design all complete the pieces of the puzzle for a complete notebook. And Apple delivers on that front, even if one has to pay a price for it. But no one can take credit away from Apple for making the experience smooth. By experience, I don’t just mean macOS, the software that powers the Mac, but also little things like the Apple migration assistant that seamlessly transfers apps and settings from an older Mac to a new Mac.

Why it is necessary to diversify the farming basket,"If farmers’ incomes are to be augmented substantially, Punjab and Haryana have plenty of lessons to learn from states that have already moved into high-value agriculture",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Diversify-the-basket_Premium-01.jpg?w=640,"Punjab, caught up in a rice-wheat system induced by the MSP regime and open-ended procurement, along with free power and highly subsidised fertilisers, failed to diversify to high-value agriculture. (Illustration by CR Sasikumar)","Let us start with a simple question: Which state do you think is most productive in terms of value creation in agriculture on a per hectare (ha) basis? If Punjab comes to mind, you are very off the mark. Punjab, known for its high physical productivity of rice and wheat, falls at number 13 amongst Indian states when it comes to agri-value created — agri-GDP on a per ha basis. There could be at least two ways to estimate it. First, divide state agri-GDP by Net Sown Area (NSA); and second, divide agri-GDP by Gross Cropped Area (GCA), which encompasses the effect of cropping intensity. Here we use both indicators for the year 2021-22, for which the latest information is available.

Punjab ranks 13th with Rs 3.71 lakh/ha, with Jharkhand trailing at Rs 4.41 lakh/ha. And if that wasn’t enough of a reality check, the disparity becomes starker when we consider agri-GDP/ha of GCA. In this regard, Bihar with Rs 2.18 lakh/ha, Odisha with Rs 2.57/ha, and Assam with Rs 2.34/ha outpace Punjab with Rs 1.92 lakh/ha (see infographic).

Express View on 2024 general elections: Lok in Lok Sabha,"Close to a billion voters, a million moving parts -- no one narrative explains 2024.

To be sure, there is a danger in overly romanticising the tryst with the EVM, especially in a polity with weakly institutionalised accountability, and the special polling stations to be set up in Manipur’s relief camps will present a sobering image — free and fair elections are only one part of the democratic promise, not the whole of it. It is also true that the polarisation is set to sharpen as the battle lines are more tightly drawn. But this is also the first election after, on the Supreme Court’s prodding, data on electoral bonds has been placed in the public domain.

It is also true that the polarisation is set to sharpen as the battle lines are more tightly drawn. But this is also the first election after, on the Supreme Court’s prodding, data on electoral bonds has been placed in the public domain. There is room for more disclosures and the dots will continue to be connected in days to come. But there could not be better news for the voter’s right to know.

Express View on Eu’s AI law: Strive for an intelligent balance,"EU’s AI Act could guide framing of similar laws elsewhere. For India, challenge is to address risks without stifling innovation",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/express-view-26.jpg?w=640,"In this regard, the ministry’s replacement last week of its March 1 advisory, which required generative AI companies to seek government permission for deploying “untested” systems, with a new one that drops this condition, is welcome","Last week, lawmakers in the European Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of the Artificial Intelligence Act, putting the landmark legislation on track to take effect by the end of the year. While governments across the world are moving to put up guardrails, including Japan, Brazil and the US, where on October 30, President Joe Biden signed an executive order on AI safety — the European Union’s new law is the first comprehensive framework for governing a technology that has seen explosive growth in recent years, dominating headlines and stoking both excitement and fear about the future.
Taking a horizontal, risk-based approach that will apply across sectors of AI development, the EU AI Act classifies the technology into four categories: Prohibited, high-risk, limited-risk and minimal-risk. Systems that violate or threaten human rights through, for example, social scoring — creating “risk” profiles of people based on “desirable” or “undesirable” behaviour — or mass surveillance are banned outright.

Express View on ECI’s disclosure: Bonds that link,"Electoral bonds data pierces veil of secrecy, raises troubling questions. More disclosure is needed -- the citizen must know",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/express-view-22.jpg?w=640,The revelations of donor names will help pierce the black box of the relationship between big business and politics.,"Compelled by the Supreme Court, the State Bank of India and the Election Commission have released a list of those who purchased electoral bonds, taking a long step towards lifting the veil of secrecy over campaign finance in India. This is, undoubtedly, a watershed moment for transparency, and the citizen’s right to know — which lie at the heart of the democratic pact and promise. The Court’s judgment striking down the electoral bonds scheme, and its subsequent order pushing the SBI to submit the data are, therefore, immensely welcome. The revelations of donor names will help pierce the black box of the relationship between big business and politics.
At one level, it is deeply symbiotic — the list points to the possibility of some donations being linked to entities securing lucrative contracts or licences at both the central and state level. There are also indications of donations to political parties tending to follow investigations against the donor companies by agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate. The data points to a severely skewed system of election finance that the ruling party at the Centre and in several states, the BJP, has evidently benefitted from.

The actor took to the stage on day four of the fashion gala where the designers showcased their clothing line titled “You”.
At the post-show press conference, Dimri said collaborating with brothers Shantnu Mehra and Nikhil Mehra was an “amazing” experience.
“Being confident and being inherently powerful in their own beautiful version… There is nothing more beautiful than a confident woman and I think this show stands for it.

The actor was dressed in a black lace-corset bodice, long steel-grey figure-hugging sequinned skirt and a pair of black lace gloves. She kept her look minimal with smokey eyes, sans jewellery.
According to the designers, the collection is “a testament to the power of resilience, and celebration of the indomitable spirit of women grounded in individuality and fortitude”.
Nikhil Mehra, one-half of the designer duo, emphasised the importance of teamwork in life and work.
“Our parents brought us up like a team. Ever since Shantanu and I were kids, we have been together and that’s all owed to our parents. They gave us the upbringing to understand that you cannot do anything on your own… I want to take this opportunity and tell our team back in the office that it is one big family,” he added.

FYI:
— Recently, the first phase of India’s Atmospheric Research Testbed in Central India (ART-CI) was inaugurated at Silkheda in Sehore district, located about 50 km northwest of Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.
— It was funded by the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES). Hence, statement 3 is not correct.
— The facility will house 25 cutting-edge meteorological instruments for studying critical cloud dynamics linked with monsoons over central India’s Monsoon Core Zone (MCZ).
— The ART is an open-field, focused observational and analytical research programme at Silkheda.
— The facility intends to conduct ground-based observations of weather parameters such as temperature and wind speeds, as well as in-situ (on-site) observations of transient synoptic systems such as low-pressure areas and depressions that form in the Bay of Bengal during the southwest monsoon season, which runs from June to September. Hence, statement 1 is correct and statement 4 is not correct.
Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer.
FYI:
— The Model Code of Conduct (MCC) will come into immediate effect after the announcement of schedule for the upcoming Lok Sabha and state Assembly elections.
— The MCC is a collection of guidelines published to govern political parties and candidates ahead of elections. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
— It regulates speeches, campaigning, the content of election manifestos, behaviour at polling booths, and other aspects to ensure that the country’s elections are free and fair. Hence, statement 2 is not correct and statement 3 is correct.
Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer.
FYI:
— The High-level Committee (HLC) on One Nation, One Election submitted its report to President Droupadi Murmu.
— Simultaneous elections, popularly referred to as “One Nation, One Election”, means holding elections to Lok Sabha, all state Legislative Assemblies, and urban and rural local bodies (municipalities and panchayats) at the same time.
— According to the FAQs, the committee has made the following recommendations:
(i) Amending the Constitution
— The Constitution should be amended to enable simultaneous elections in two steps:
(a) In the first step, simultaneous elections will be held to Lok Sabha and State Assemblies. For this, no ratification by the states will be required for the constitutional amendment.
(b) In the second step, elections to municipalities and the panchayats will be synchronised with elections to Lok Sabha and state Assemblies in such a way that local body elections are held within 100 days of the elections to Lok Sabha and state Assemblies. This will require ratification by not less than one-half of the states.
(ii) Single electoral roll and Election ID
— The Constitution should be amended to allow the Election Commission of India to prepare a single electoral roll and electoral photo identity cards for use in elections to all three levels of government in consultation with state election commissions. These amendments will require ratification by at least half of the states.
(iii) In case of hung house, etc
— In the event of a hung House, a no-confidence motion, or any such event, fresh elections should be held to constitute the new Lok Sabha or state Assembly for the unexpired term of the House.
(iv) Meeting Logistics Requirements
— The committee has recommended that for meeting logistical requirements, the Election Commission of India will plan and estimate in advance, in consultation with the State Election Commissions, and take steps for the deployment of manpower, polling personnel, security forces, EVMs/VVPATs, etc., so that free and fair simultaneous elections are held in all the three tiers of the government.
Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.
FYI:
— Google DeepMind revealed its latest AI gaming agent called SIMA or Scalable Instructable Multiworld Agent, which can follow natural language instructions to perform tasks across video game environments.
— SIMA takes us a step closer to AI which can intelligently collaborate with humans not only in games but also in doing tasks in real-world environments. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
— SIMA can be called a generalist AI Agent that is capable of doing different kinds of tasks. It can accomplish tasks or solve challenges assigned to it.
— It is capable of doing different kinds of tasks and understands and follows instructions in all sorts of virtual environments. Hence, statement 3 is correct.
— SIMA “understands” your commands as it has been trained to process human language. So when you ask it to build a castle or find the treasure chest, it understands exactly what these commands mean.
— It is capable of learning and adapting. SIMA does this through the interactions it has with the user. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.
Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer.
FYI:
— India and Brazil explored ways to expand cooperation in areas of energy, critical minerals, technology and counter-terrorism at their first ‘2+2’ defence and foreign ministerial dialogue.
— Defence, space, energy, vital minerals, technology, counterterrorism, and other mutually beneficial problems were among the topics discussed.
— The dialogue took place in Delhi.
— It was co-chaired by G V Srinivas, additional secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs, and Vishwesh Negi, joint Secretary in the Ministry of Defence.
— The Brazilian delegation was led by Rear Admiral Fernando de Luca Marques de Oliviera and Director of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, Marcelo Camara.
— India is having 2+2 dialogue with United States, Russia, Japan, Australia and United Kingdom.
Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.
FYI:
— The vital second stage of India’s three-stage nuclear programme got a boost with the commencement of ‘core loading’ at the country’s first indigenous Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR) at Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu. Hence, statement 3 is not correct.
— Core loading is the process of placing nuclear fuel assemblies inside the core of a nuclear reactor.
— It is a project in which electricity is produced from uranium in nuclear power reactors. Hence, statement 1 is not correct.
— The project has been supported by successive governments as a step towards India gaining comprehensive skills that span the full nuclear fuel cycle, which is the process by which uranium is converted into energy in nuclear power reactors. The project to create an FBR was started twenty years ago.
— In 2003, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was Prime Minister, the Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam Ltd or BHAVINI was incorporated to build and operate India’s most advanced nuclear reactor, the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR). Hence, statement 2 is correct.
— Once commissioned, India will be the second country after Russia to have a commercial operating FBR. Hence, statement 4 is correct.
Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer.
FYI:
— A biogas plant requires fresh manure, which contains both methane and water.
—Bovines make methane in their rumen (the first of four stomach compartments), where bacteria ferment or break down the plant material they eat before it is further digested.
— Carbohydrate fermentation produces carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen.
— Archaea (bacteria-like germs in the rumen) consume them to make methane, which the animal then expels as gas or manure.
— Anaerobic digestion is a process by which the complex organic matter in dung is broken down in the absence of oxygen to produce biogas.
— The digestion, taking place in a 3,000 cubic-meter sealed vessel reactor, involves four successive stages:

While Einstein was a genius with many scientific breakthroughs to his name, he was also a Jew, who could not escape the political and ideological currents of his time.
— Einstein had to take US citizenship after the Nazis came to power in his country Germany, and raided his house while he was away on a visiting professorship at the California Institute of Technology.
— Einstein favoured the creation of a state of Israel for all persecuted Jews — the philosophy of Zionism — although he also wanted “reasonable agreement with the Arabs”. When the fate of Israel was to be decided at the UN in 1947, Zionist leaders were trying to secure support from across the world. To persuade the leader of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, they approached Einstein.
— Einstein, thus, wrote to Nehru on June 13, 1947, underlining the reasons India should support Israel. Nehru wrote back on July 11, 1947, with a polite but firm no.
Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.
FYI:

Who was Nana Jagannath Shankarseth?
— The social reformer, educationist, and philanthropist Nana Jagannath Shankarseth (February 10, 1803-July 31, 1865) is often described as the “architect” of Mumbai (then Bombay), who made extremely valuable contributions in terms of both ideas and money to multiple sectors, to lay a strong foundation for the city.
— Born in a wealthy Brahmin family in Murbad in Thane district, Shankarseth took the responsibility of running the family business at an early age after his father passed away in 1822. Shankarseth was greatly inspired by the legendary merchant and philanthropist Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy.
— As a social reformer and community leader, Shankarseth earned the goodwill of both Indians and the British. He became the first Indian to be nominated to the Legislative Council of Bombay.
Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.
FYI:
— The Karnataka government recently “banned” the use of harmful colouring agents in gobhi manchurian and cotton candy, with a violation attracting imprisonment of up to 7 years and fine of up to Rs 10 lakhs, Karnataka health minister Dinesh Gundu Rao said.
— “Consumption of snacks containing these artificial colours may pose long-term health risks, including cancer. Therefore, the health department has taken this necessary action,” he said.
— Artificial colouring was found in 107 of the 171 gobhi manchurian samples tested by the state government, and in 15 of the 25 cotton candy samples tested. “Based on these findings, an order has been issued banning the use of prohibited artificial colours, including Rhodamine B, in Gobi Manchurian and cotton candy,” the minister said.
What is Rhodamine B?

It covers essential topics of static and dynamic parts of the UPSC Civil Services syllabus covered under various GS papers. This answer-writing practice is designed to help you as a value addition to your UPSC CSE Mains. Attempt today’s answer writing on questions related to topics of GS-1 to check your progress.
Modern pedagogy and age-old wisdom can benefit Indian students taking open-book exams. Discuss.
What are the different types of vegetation identified in India? Why are forest fires in the hills intensifying, and what are the causes of forest fires?
Introduction
— The introduction of the answer is essential and should be restricted to 3-5 lines. Remember, a one-liner is not a standard introduction.
— It may consist of basic information by giving some definitions from the trusted source and authentic facts.
Body
— It is the central part of the answer and one should understand the demand of the question to provide rich content.
— The answer must be preferably written as a mix of points and short paragraphs rather than using long paragraphs or just points.
— Using facts from authentic government sources makes your answer more comprehensive. Analysis is important based on the demand of the question, but do not over analyse.
— Underlining keywords gives you an edge over other candidates and enhances presentation of the answer.
— Using flowcharts/tree-diagram in the answers saves much time and boosts your score. However, it should be used logically and only where it is required.
Way forward/ conclusion
— The ending of the answer should be on a positive note and it should have a forward-looking approach. However, if you feel that an important problem must be highlighted, you may add it in your conclusion. Try not to repeat any point from body or introduction.
— You may use the findings of reports or surveys conducted at national and international levels, quotes etc. in your answers.
Self Evaluation
— It is the most important part of our Mains answer writing practice. UPSC Essentials will provide some guiding points or ideas as a thought process that will help you to evaluate your answers.
QUESTION 1: Modern pedagogy and age-old wisdom can benefit Indian students taking open-book exams. Discuss.
Introduction:
— The open book examination (OBE) approach simply means teaching, developing, and empowering people to apply theory in practice.
— It is a system that safeguards humans’ core nature, which is to be curious and innovative.
— The goal of OBE is to solve real-world issues via discussion, debate, and critical thinking; this approach departs significantly from the colonial-era conformity-over-creativity paradigm.
Body:
You may incorporate some of the following points in the body of your answer:
— Despite the importance of this traditional system in generating leaders across sectors, the requirement for accepting OBE is acknowledging the necessity for an educational reform driven by globalisation and technology improvements.
— In order to accomplish this, it will be necessary to blend traditional knowledge with contemporary teaching methods, thereby educating Indian young for leadership positions around the world.
— The traditional emphasis on rote memorization was significantly altered with the advent of OBE. To make this shift, it is necessary to acknowledge the limitations of the current educational system’s preference on memorization over analysis. Furthermore, with the current educational paradigm becoming outdated, there is a risk of “moronization of masses” due to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and deep learning technologies.
— The purpose is to assess students’ critical thinking skills, innovative knowledge application, and sophisticated problem solving abilities, all of which are not only timely but also important in an age dominated by AI and digital technology. The aim here is to provide test questions that challenge pupils to demonstrate knowledge and application rather than simply memorising facts.
Conclusion:
— This paradigm change is critical in an era where traditional academic achievements, measured by grades, are becoming increasingly separated from the requirements for higher education and the professional world, as indicated by efforts such as the Common University Entrance Test.
— OBE offers a learning environment that goes beyond the constraints of memorization. Actually, the shift started a few years ago when the percentage of competency-based, analytical, and applied questions in the exams grew over time. The effectiveness of this strategy will be replicated in a learning atmosphere reminiscent of traditional gurukuls, where creative teaching techniques will be incorporated through ongoing assessments.

Discuss the main objectives of Population Education and point out the measures to achieve them in India in detail. (2021)
QUESTION 2: What are the different types of vegetation identified in India? Why are forest fires in the hills intensifying, and what are the causes of forest fires?
Introduction:
— Natural vegetation refers to a plant community, which has grown naturally without human aid and has been left undisturbed by humans for a long time.
— There are various types of vegetation which are identified in our country:
(i) Tropical Evergreen Forests
(ii) Tropical Deciduous Forests
(iii) Tropical Thorn Forests and Scrubs
(iv) Montane Forests
(v) Mangrove Forests
Body:
You may incorporate some of the following points in the body of your answer:
— Forest fires are broadly categorised into three categories – ground, surface and crown fire.
— Fires that burn organic material in the soil are called ground fires, and they burn slowly, under vegetation.
— Surface fires are caused largely by burning of dry leaves, branches and other materials on the ground. Such fires spread swiftly, as in the case of fires in Himachal.
— Crown fires burn quickly, from one tree top to another and have huge flames with intense heat. Such fires are rare in India.
— The number of forest fire points rose from 8,735 to 42,486 during the four weeks in March last year. Forest fires continue to scorch several hectares of green cover in the Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.
Causes of Forest Fires
— The forest fire season in India lasts between November to June and there are several factors responsible for forests fires like:
Temperatures
Precipitation
Vegetation, and
Moisture.
— According to the Forest Survey of India, nearly 36 per cent of India’s forests are prone to frequent fires. Higher fire incidents are reported in March, April and May due to ample availability of dry biomass (fuel load) following the end of winter and the ongoing summer season.
— Most forest fires are man-made due to changes in agriculture and unchecked land-use patterns.

North Korea fires ballistic missiles as Blinken visits Seoul,"South Korea's military said multiple short-range missiles were fired from a region south of the North's capital, Pyongyang, landing east of the Korean peninsula.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/korea-1.jpg?w=640,"A TV screen shows a file image of North Korea's missile launch during a news program at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)","North Korea fired ballistic missiles into the sea on Monday for the first time in two months, as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Seoul for a conference hosted by President Yoon Suk Yeol on advancing democracy.
South Korea’s military said multiple short-range missiles were fired from a region south of the North’s capital, Pyongyang, landing east of the Korean peninsula. It did not provide further details and said it was sharing information on the launch with the United States and Japan.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned the launches after his country’s coast guard also reported the firing of what it said appeared to be a ballistic missile and specified that it had already ended its flight.
Japan later said that it had detected what appeared to be a second ballistic missile launch by the North, and that both fell outside its exclusive economic zone area.
“North Korea’s series of actions threaten the peace and security of our region and the international community, and are absolutely unacceptable,” Kishida said, calling the launch a violation of U.N. resolutions.
North Korea’s military has been conducting exercises using conventional weapons in recent weeks, often personally overseen by the isolated state’s leader, Kim Jong Un.
The show of force by Pyongyang comes just after the militaries of South Korea and the United States finished 10 days of large-scale annual joint military drills last Thursday.
On Sunday, the South Korean military also mobilised marines, attack helicopters and amphibious assault vehicles in drills aimed at surging troop numbers to reinforce western islands near the sea border with North Korea. The North shelled the islands in 2010.
Blinken is among senior officials from around the world attending the Summit for Democracy conference, which opens on Monday. He will also meet his South Korean counterpart, foreign minister Cho Tae-yul.
The summit is an initiative of US President Joe Biden aimed at discussing ways to stop democratic backsliding and erosion of rights and freedoms worldwide.
In its last ballistic launch on Jan. 14, North Korea fired what it said was an intermediate range hypersonic missile using solid fuel on to test new booster engines and a manoeuvrable warhead.
A month later, it launched multiple cruise missiles off its east coast, including what it said was a new anti-ship missile."

"Who is Robert F Kennedy Jr, the third player in US presidential elections 2024?","Robert F Kennedy Jr built a reputation of his own as an activist, author and lawyer who fought for environmental causes such as clean water.

(Reuters, file)","The lack of excitement many Americans feel about a presidential rematch has heightened interest in alternatives to the major-party candidates, none more so than Robert F Kennedy Jr., whose famous name has helped him build buzz for his independent bid.
Kennedy is a huge longshot to win Electoral College votes, much less the presidency. But his campaign events have drawn large crowds of supporters and people interested in his message. He plans to announce his vice presidential nominee later this month in Oakland, California, and is stoking expectations that he might pick New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers or former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura.
Here is a look at his campaign and what he’s stood for:
Kennedy, 70, is a member of perhaps the nation’s most famous political dynasty. His uncle was President John F Kennedy. His father served as attorney general and a US senator before seeking the Democratic nomination for president. Both were assassinated.
Because of your support, this is now the most successful independent campaign in decades. Together, we have shown that Americans really are tired of the vitriol and division. Americans are looking for a leader who can “Heal The Divide.”

RFK Jr built a reputation of his own as an activist, author and lawyer who fought for environmental causes such as clean water. More recently, his activism has veered into conspiracies and contradicted scientific consensus, most infamously on vaccines. Some members of his family have publicly criticised his views.
Kennedy founded Waterkeeper Alliance, which works to secure clean water, and Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group that saw its reach grow rapidly during the pandemic. Children’s Health Defense has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organisations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about Covid-19 and Coivid-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.
He’s married to actress Cheryl Hines.
What does Kennedy’s campaign look like?
Kennedy’s need to collect thousands of signatures to get on the ballot has taken him to places that rarely see presidential candidates, including Hawaii, Wyoming and West Virginia.
At events in Phoenix and Las Vegas, hundreds of supporters queued up outside hours before he was scheduled to arrive. He attracts a legion of fans, many of whom have listened extensively to Kennedy’s interviews on podcasts or YouTube videos.
Americans are sick of the DNC and the courts interfering with our election process. It’s not good for our country; this isn’t a banana republic. I explained to @andrewschulz that I want to beat Biden and Trump on an even battlefield.

In Nevada, massive graphics and photos were projected on three walls as upbeat music played. Drinks and merchandise were for sale. Kennedy speaks in a quiet, strained voice, sometimes haltingly, the result of a neurological condition called spasmodic dysphonia.
What does he talk about?
Kennedy frames himself as a truthteller with a track record of fighting for the middle class against powerful interests. He points to lawsuits he’s won against corporate behemoths such as Monsanto and DuPont.
“I can fix this country,” he said in Las Vegas in February. “All these agencies that intimidate normal politicians, I’ve sued every one of them. … When you sue these agencies, you get a Ph.D. in corporate capture and how to unravel it.” Corporate capture refers to private interests using their influence to control government decision-making, as when they help draft legislation.
Kennedy has been critical of US support for Ukraine and supportive of Israel’s war against Hamas. He wants to reduce military and health care spending because of the impact on budget deficits, and combat rising housing costs so young people can afford to buy homes. Kennedy has found a loyal following among people distrustful of institutions and those who believe the government has been captured by corporations, especially pharmaceutical companies.
He hasn’t shied away from his controversial views on health care and vaccines. He wants to dismantle the public health bureaucracy, saying he’d immediately tell the National Institutes of Health to refocus research away from infectious diseases and vaccines and toward chronic diseases.
Kennedy insists he is not anti-vaccine and claims he has never told the public to avoid vaccination. But he has repeatedly made his opposition to vaccines clear. He said on a podcast “there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective” and has urged people to resist CDC guidelines on when kids should get vaccinated.
While there are rare instances when people have severe reactions to vaccines, the billions of doses administered globally provide real-world evidence that they are safe. The World Health Organisation says vaccines prevent as many as 5 million deaths each year.
Can he win?
The United States has a long history of rejecting independent or third-party presidential candidates. In fact, the last president to win without a party’s backing was George Washington, and he did it before there were political parties.
The last third-party candidate to make it to the White House was Abraham Lincoln with the newly formed Republican Party. The last third-party candidate to pull more than single digits in the popular vote was Ross Perot, a businessman who won 19% in 1992 and 8% in 1996. But he won zero electoral votes.
And while the independent share of the electorate is growing, it is still dwarfed by voters who consistently support Republican or Democratic candidates, even if they identify as independent. In other words, the odds are long.
Kennedy’s case for optimism hinges on his relatively strong showing in a few national polls. Polls during the 2016 presidential campaign regularly put libertarian Gary Johnson’s support in the high single or low double digits, but he ultimately received only about 3% of the vote nationwide.
Horse-race polls are also notoriously unreliable this far out from an election, and many Americans don’t know who Kennedy is. A February AP-NORC poll found, for instance, that 29% of Americans don’t know enough about Kennedy to have a view about him.
Some of the people who say they’d support him may also be reacting to his famous last name rather than his actual pitch as a candidate. A CNN/SSRS poll conducted last spring found that 20% of people who said they would consider supporting Kennedy for the Democratic nomination — for which he was running at the time — said that their support was related to his last name and Kennedy family connections. Only 12% said it was because of support for his views and policies.
But for any of that to matter, he has to get on the ballot.
How does he get on the ballot?
Forget getting elected; merely running for president is an arduous process, especially for candidates like Kennedy who don’t belong to a party. Every state has different rules, requiring an army of lawyers to make sure everything is done right. Most states require thousands of signatures.
A pro-Kennedy super PAC is helping pay for Kennedy’s ballot access work in several states. His allies have created a political party to ease the process in some states by getting recognised as a party and making Kennedy its nominee.
He has been approved for the ballot in Utah. His campaign and super PAC say he’s collected enough signatures to qualify in several other states, including the battlegrounds of Arizona, Georgia and Nevada, though election officials in those states have not yet affirmed his candidacy.
Kennedy has also said he’s talked with officials from the Libertarian Party, though it’s not clear what a tie-up between the two might look like.
Who is working for him?
Kennedy is looking to his family and his allies in the anti-vaccine world to staff his campaign, building a leadership team that is light on experience working in politics. His campaign manager is Amaryllis Fox Kennedy, his daughter-in-law who served as a CIA officer and has not worked in politics before.
His communications director, Del Bigtree, is founder of the Informed Consent Action Network, an anti-vaccine group. He also produced “Vaxxed,” an anti-vaccine film that promoted the discredited idea that the vaccines cause autism.
Press secretary Stefanie Spear was an editor for the Children’s Health Defense news website. Charles Eisenstein, a New Age author, is an adviser. Kennedy also has staff and volunteers spread throughout states and focused on gathering signatures to get him on the ballot."

(Reuters, file)","The lack of excitement many Americans feel about a presidential rematch has heightened interest in alternatives to the major-party candidates, none more so than Robert F Kennedy Jr., whose famous name has helped him build buzz for his independent bid.
Kennedy is a huge longshot to win Electoral College votes, much less the presidency. But his campaign events have drawn large crowds of supporters and people interested in his message. He plans to announce his vice presidential nominee later this month in Oakland, California, and is stoking expectations that he might pick New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers or former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura.
Here is a look at his campaign and what he’s stood for:
Kennedy, 70, is a member of perhaps the nation’s most famous political dynasty. His uncle was President John F Kennedy. His father served as attorney general and a US senator before seeking the Democratic nomination for president. Both were assassinated.
Because of your support, this is now the most successful independent campaign in decades. Together, we have shown that Americans really are tired of the vitriol and division. Americans are looking for a leader who can “Heal The Divide.”

"Putin warns, Russia-NATO conflict is just one step from World War 3","Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, triggering major European war",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/putin-elections.jpg?w=640,"Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks on a visit to his campaign headquarters after a presidential election in Moscow, early Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP)","Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the West on Monday that a direct conflict between Russia and the US-led NATO military alliance would mean the planet was one step away from World War Three but said hardly anyone wanted such a scenario.
The Ukraine war has triggered the deepest crisis in Moscow’s relations with the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Putin has often warned of the risks of nuclear war but says he has never felt the need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.
French President Emmanuel Macron last month said he could not rule out the deployment of ground troops in Ukraine in the future, with many Western countries distancing themselves from that while others, especially in eastern Europe, expressed support.
Asked by Reuters about the Macron remarks and the risks and possibility of a conflict between Russia and NATO, Putin quipped: “everything is possible in the modern world.”
“It is clear to everyone, that this will be one step away from a full-scale World War Three. I think hardly anyone is interested in this,” Putin told reporters after winning the biggest ever landslide in post-Soviet Russian history.
Putin added, though, that NATO military personnel were present already in Ukraine, saying that Russia had picked up both English and French being spoken on the battlefield.
“There is nothing good in this, first of all for them, because they are dying there and in large numbers,” he said.
BUFFER ZONE
Ahead of the March 15-17 Russian election, Ukraine stepped up attacks against Russia, shelling border regions and even used proxies to try to pierce Russia’s borders.
Asked if he considered it necessary to take Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, Putin said if the attacks continued, Russia would create a buffer zone out of more Ukrainian territory to defend Russian territory.
“I do not exclude that, bearing in mind the tragic events taking place today, we will be forced at some point, when we deem it appropriate, to create a certain ‘sanitary zone’ in the territories today under the Kyiv regime,” Putin said.
He declined to give any further details but said such a zone might have to be big enough to preclude foreign made armaments from reaching Russian territory.
Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, triggering major European war after eight years of conflict in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian forces on one side and pro-Russian Ukrainians and Russian proxies on the other.
Putin said he wished Macron would stop seeking to aggravate the war in Ukraine but to play a role in finding peace: “It seems that France could play a role. All is not lost yet.”
“I’ve been saying it over and over again and I’ll say it again. We are for peace talks, but not just because the enemy is running out of bullets,” Putin said.
“If they really, seriously, want to build peaceful, good-neighbourly relations between the two states in the long term, and not simply take a break for rearmament for 1.5-2 years.”
US DEMOCRACY
Putin dismissed US and Western criticism of the election, which the White House said was not free and fair, saying US elections were not democratic and criticising the use of state power against Donald Trump.
“The whole world is laughing at what is happening there,” Putin said of the United States. “It is just a catastrophe – it is not democracy – what on earth is it?”
When asked about the fate of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in unexplained circumstances at a Russian prison in the Arctic on Feb. 16, Putin said he had simply “passed away” using Navalny’s name for one of the first times in public.
Putin said he had agreed several days before Navalny’s death to swap him. Reuters reported in February that a prisoner exchange deal had been agreed for Navalny shortly before his death.
“I said: ‘I am agreed’,” Putin said about his approval for the prisoner swap. “I had one condition – we exchange him but he never returns.”
Navalny’s widow, Yulia, has accused Putin of killing her husband. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that claim was simply wrong."

Margaret Cousins: The Irish suffragette who fought for voting rights of Indian women,"On Women's History Month, Adrija Roychowdhury digs deep into the life of Margaret Cousins, an Irish suffragist who fought hard for women's voting right in India. She drafted the first demand for women's voting rights in India to the British and mentored the likes of Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay and Muthulakshmi Reddy who led the movement for the political rights of Indian women.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/Margaret-cousins.jpg?w=640,The shared colonial history between India and Ireland went a long way in shaping the work that Margaret would later undertake among Indian women. (Wikimedia Commons),"After a particularly fervent struggle demanding the inclusion of women in the Indian legislature, the Madras State Provincial Legislature was the first to open its doors to female candidates in 1927. The move though was far from being full-hearted, for only a few weeks remained for a fresh election. “It was bound to be an unequal contest,” wrote Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay in her memoir. Chattopadhyay, who became the first-ever Indian woman to run for a seat in the legislature, was aware of the challenge at hand. “It seemed too late and would need a bulldog’s courage for a woman to venture into the fray,” she wrote.
It was an Irish lady though who stood firm behind Chattopadhyay’s candidature, unfettered and undaunted by the limits that time and incapacities posed. Margaret Cousins, or Gretta, as she was known among her close circle, was the one who launched Chattopadhyay into the contest for the Madras Legislative Council and stirred up a most remarkable campaign in that regard. To begin with, Chattopadhyay was not even listed as a voter for the lack of property ownership. It was Margaret who hurriedly arranged for a long-term lease of some property to enable her to vote. Thereon, she embarked upon a political campaign of the most creative kind, brimming with music, cultural shows, and spirited volunteers wearing dark blue badges.
Although Chattopadhyay lost the poll by a margin of only 55 votes, she recollected in her memoir that “it was an election that people continued to remember over several years as a great experience.” Margaret and her role in ensuring political rights for Indian women, however, lies forgotten and buried deep under pages of archives. In 1917, she founded one of the earliest pan-India women’s associations — The Women’s India Association (WIA) — in Adyar, Madras. In 1919, she created history by drafting for the first time the demand for women’s voting rights in India to the Southborough Committee in London. Quite apart from women’s issues, Margaret’s cultural contributions also ought to be remarked upon, for it was she who set the tune to the English version of Rabindranath Tagore’s ‘Jana Gana Mana’ that went on to become the National Anthem of India.
In 1878, when Margaret was born at Boyle, County Roscommon in Ireland, the country was a colony of England. The shared colonial history between India and Ireland went a long way in shaping the work that Margaret would later undertake among Indian women.
She belonged to a devout Irish Protestant family. From an early age itself, Margaret was sharply aware of women’s issues. In the autobiography, We Two Together (1950) which she wrote along with her husband James Cousins, Margaret spoke about the struggles she saw her mother go through due to lack of economic independence. “My mother had to present the various passbooks to my father and ask for the amounts. There were blank looks on these occasions. He grumbled at the amounts and spoke to her as if it was her fault,” she wrote. “And it was there and then that my girlish determination began to try and change the financial status of wives and mothers, who all worked so hard and got no money for themselves,” she added, pointing out, “One of my missions in life, equal rights of men and women, was finding me.”

Hence, simpler metrics such as counting steps can be useful to promote physical activity in India,” says Shivangi Bajpai, a doctoral student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst Department of Kinesiology, US. She along with lead author Dr Amanda Paluch, Assistant Professor at University of Massachusetts, recently published a study titled Prospectiver Association Of Daily Steps with Cardiovascular Disease: A harmonized meta-analysis in the journal Circulation. The study suggests that people over 60 may significantly reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) by walking between 6,000-9,000 steps per day. Researchers, who analysed data from over 20,000 people in the US and 42 other countries, found that compared to people who walked 2,000 steps per day, those walking between 6,000 and 9,000 steps daily had a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes, by 40 per cent to 50 per cent.

Watch this Space: SpaceX’s lost Starship and NASA’s not-yet-lost Voyager 1,"The most powerful rocket in the world, SpaceX's Starship, had its third test launch on Thursday. Unlike the previous two attempts, it did not explode, and this is a significant step forward for SpaceX despite losing the Starship during re-entry.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/spacex-starship.jpg?w=640,Starship launching for the third time (Image credit: Elon Musk/X),"It was a big week for SpaceX. Starship, the most powerful rocket in the world built by the company, had its third test launch on Thursday and unlike the previous two attempts, it did not explode. That is a big success for the Elon Musk-led company despite the fact it lost the actual spacecraft when it tried to re-enter Earth. While SpaceX lost a Starship, NASA is pulling out all stops to ensure that it does not lose Voyager 1, the most distant man-made object in space.
But surely, not exploding is a very low bar for a rocket? Well, not really. It is almost as if rockets love to explode. In fact, the day before the third Starship launch, Kairos, a privately-built Japanese rocket, exploded shortly after take off. And Kairos is not particularly large; its size means that it is dwarfed by the likes of SpaceX’s Falcon 9. And the thing is, Falcon 9 is a child’s playtoy compared to Starship.

It makes extensive use of data, reports and studies, and draws on the author’s 35-plus years of experience that includes visiting more than 95 percent of India’s districts.
Sinha raises a fundamental question of public policy: should Amrit Kaal India grow by a GDP number, the “5 trillion dollar economy”, or by the well-being of her people by investing in education, health, skills, basic amenities, and transparent governance? He makes a clear choice for the latter. He also lays great emphasis on diversifying the livelihoods base of 24 crore poor people and strengthening their assets base to move them out of perennial poverty. He suggests improving governance not only for “ease of growing” but “ease of living”.

Ecologist Madhav Gadgil’s memoir proves empathy must form the basis of policy solutions,"Gadgil grew up inspired by anti-casteism, studied in the US during the McCarthy era, and criticised his scientific peers for political inaction",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/a-walk-up-in-the-hill.jpg?w=640,'A Walk Up the Hill' by Madhav Gadgil. (Source: Amazon.in),"I
n the annals of science, there are rare scholars whose names are synonymous with their discipline of expertise. Amongst them is Madhav Gadgil. For five decades, his scholarship has expanded the frontiers of ecological sciences and made the discipline sensitive to Indian — and Third World — idiosyncrasies. Gadgil’s illustrious career arc, in more ways than one, tells us the story of Indian ecology of the past 50 years. His autobiography, A Walk Up the Hill, is also an extraordinary account of the country trying to reconcile economic development with the protection of wildlife, forests, mountains, rivers and aquifers.
An ecologist’s affiliations are multi-disciplinary in the most expansive sense of the term — it encompasses sensitivity to social mores, economics, history along with an understanding of the natural world. Compassion and empathy are central to such research. As a teacher, field researcher, scientist, author, member of policy-making bodies and institution builder, Gadgil has not just exemplified his discipline’s credo, he has also shaped it.

"Under Ayushman Bharat, top treatments: cardiology, cancer, general surgery, orthopaedics","As far as specific procedures are concerned, the top five in terms of total expenditure over six years: are dialysis, angioplasty, single stent to unblock arteries, Caesarean deliveries and implants for fractured hip.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/03/investigation-overlay-1600x900-1.jpg?w=640,An analysis of NHA data and the Ayushman dashboard sheds light on where the government's healthcare spending linked to the scheme is directed. File,"In the six years since the Centre’s flagship free health insurance scheme Ayushman Bharat was launched in September 2018, more than a quarter of the total money spent by the government in treating the poor has been in five key specialties — cardiology (heart); general medicine; general surgery; orthopaedics (bones); and medical and radiation oncology (cancer).
Data analysed by The Indian Express from the dashboard of the National Health Authority, the apex body overseeing implementation of Ayushman Bharat, and obtained under the Right to Information Act shows that cardiology tops the expenditure chart, followed closely by general medicine, general surgery, orthopaedics, and medical oncology. These five (see chart) cumulatively account for Rs 20,591 crore, or 28 per cent of the total government expenditure of Rs 72,817 crore under the scheme.

(Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal)","Over six years since the Centre’s flagship health insurance scheme Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) was launched in 2018, two-thirds of the total money spent under the scheme each year went to private hospitals across the country. This came from 2.95 crore patients — 54% of all beneficiaries till December 2023, an investigation of official records and data obtained under the Right to Information by The Indian Express reveals.
The scheme is jointly funded by the Centre and the states in the ratio 60:40 (90:10 in the case of North-East and hilly states). Government hospitals account for 58% of all facilities empanelled.
In a country where the private sector anyway accounts for more hospitalisation cases — 60% in urban areas and 52% in rural areas — this trend affirms that for a big section of the population that was dipping into its savings for treatment in private hospitals, the Ayushman Bharat scheme has significantly reduced their out-of-pocket healthcare spending. The government’s own data suggests that average medical expenditure in private hospitals is 6-8 times that in government hospitals.
Launched in September 2018, AB-PMJAY aims to achieve universal health coverage and substantially decrease out-of-pocket healthcare expenses among the poor, for whom a health emergency often leads to further impoverishment and debts.
Of the Rs 72,817 crore total expenditure under the scheme since 2018, Rs 48,778 crore – 67% — went to private healthcare facilities.

One, the scheme holds promise in reducing out-of-pocket expenditure of the poor. Two, it provides patients and their families access to critical medical treatments and emergency care that were previously financially unattainable. Three, its influence is most pronounced in marginalised communities, particularly Scheduled Tribes.

Speaking at StartUp Mahakumbh, Peak XV Managing Director Rajan Anandan said around USD 20 billion of private capital is lying uninvested and is committed for investment in private firms and startups in India.
Anandan said that the investment run rate in Indian startups before 2021 and 2022, was about USD 8-10 billion, which increased to USD 60 billion in 2021 and 2022 combined.
“Last year, it was USD 7 billion, which people said is low. It could have been zero because basically six years of funding came in two years.This year we are well on track to USD 8-10 or 12 billion. We are going to have an ecosystem which is going to have USD 10-12 billion for few years and it will go at natural pace that it should,” Anandan said.
He said that USD 10 billion or about Rs 80,000 crore funding per year is enough to build the Indian startup ecosystem.
Citing shift in focus of funding in the US to AI and next generation software entities, Anandan said the Indian startup ecosystem is the most vibrant ecosystem in the world.
He said that his firm last year made investments in consumer businesses which are no longer getting funded in the US.
“India today has 20 startups that are being publicly traded. We think that over the next 7-8 years, there will be 100 startups that will go public,” Anandan said.
He indicated that growth in funding is coming back across funding stages.
